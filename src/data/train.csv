Hi, another few points about the second subtitle: """"Would the preparations have been effective?"""".  I argue that this subtitle is too long. The subtitle """"Historical analysis"""" would be more concise. As well, professional historians do not usually devote time to """"counter factual"""" discussions, like """"Would the US forces in Hawaii been able to withstand an amphibious assault by Japanese forces in WW II"""", or """"If it had not been rainy in 1415, would the French knights have won at the Battle of Agincourt, rather than being trapped in the mud"""".  Historians don't spend time discussing these issues. In 1415, during the battle of Agincourt, it WAS muddy, and so the French knights DID get bogged down in the mud, and so that is the course of the battle. I would like to see a source indicating that reputable historians have discussed """"Would the preparations have been effective.""""

 Lead needs to meet MOS standards 

As it stands, the lead breaks MOS in several major ways:

 MOS:INTRO#Introductory text - In that is does not """"briefly summarize the most important points covered in an article in such a way that it can stand on its own as a concise version of the article"""".
 MOS:INTRO#Relative emphasis - In that it gives WP:UNDUE emphasis to male rape in the UK, yet section in """"Prevalence"""" covers 6 countries from which other examples could have been given. To quote MOS, """"emphasis given to material should reflect its relative importance to the subject"""" – male rape in the UK is no more important that in any other country in the world, therefore it should not be used as a singular example because this does not represent a worldwide view, particularly as anything related to anal sex differs per culture, religion and by law.
 The examples break the MOS:INTRO#Provide an accessible overview guideline which states: """"Do not hint at startling facts without describing them."""" The UK percentages are quoted without sufficient background to explain their relevancy this early in the article, there is no context because the lead is very short and uninformative.
 MOS:INTRO#Relative emphasis - """"Significant information should not appear in the lead if it is not covered in the remainder of the article"""" – the stated UK <3% and <5% figures are not mentioned in Male rape#United Kingdom, which would be a more appropriate place to account for these percentages, than in the lead in this disconnected manner.

The lead needs rewriting be someone who has contributed to this article and knows the sources well, it should be much longer based on the article's current length, it should be balanced and not given to undue examples from cherry-picked county data, per WP:NPOV. It needs to give a concise overview of the topic, rather than focusing on too many examples, to avoid clutter. 82.8.252.13  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Unlicensed? 

The two therapists who killed Candace Newmaker were both legally allowed to practice in Colorado.  Connell Watkins had been an unlicensed psychotherapist registered with the State of Colorado, which allowed her to practice, which she had done for over fifteen years in Colorado.  Julie Ponder was a marriage and family therapist in California, and under reciprocity agreements was allowed to practice in Colorado.  These are facts which came out in trial.

It was part of the scandal of this case that the little girl was (a) killed during what was claimed to be psychotherapy and (b) killed by persons legally allowed to practice.      Additionally, part of the importance of the case was that these convictions were the first time that practicing therapists were criminally convicted for maltreatment during a therapy session, where the criminality did not involve sexual misconduct.

Thus, it is both inaccurate and misses the point to qualify these therapists as """"unlicensed"""".  While some mental-health practitioners would like to place Newmaker's killers as outside the legal framework mental-health practice (licensing), but that is only their point of view and is not supported by the facts of the matter.

I have accordingly improved the article to remove the words """"unlicensed"""" as being wrong, POV and misleading to Wiki readers.

I have changed """"According to the literal text of the constitution, the Governor-General is the representative of the Queen of Australia."""" to refer to Queen Victoria instead. I did this to make a point and that point is that the literal text of the Constitution cannot be taken as an unfailingly reliable guide to either practice or law.

Read the Constitution and you will find no mention of the Prime Minister, who is undeniably the head of government, even if one might imagine that this position is occupied by the Governor-General from a cursory reading of the Constitution. The Constitution declares that there shall be an Inter-State Commission, but the truth is that this body does not exist.

Please, if you refer to the literal text of the Constitution, either stick to the literal text and refrain from inserting material that does not belong - you will search in vain for the title """"Queen of Australia"""", for example - or qualify it by referring to documents and events such as the Royal Style and Titles Act 1953 where the title """"Queen of Australia"""" was introduced.  23:44, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Skyring - It is interesting how your own comments can be used to demonstrate how you add your own point of view - """"I did this to make a point!"""". A point about """"literal"""" text is make by using the adjective """"literal"""". Your point belongs elsewhere.

Anyway, the literal text does not mention """"Queen Victoria"""" it mentions the """"Queen"""". It further states that the """"Name of the King or Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the time being is to be substituted from time to time"""". This is what I has done. Maybe, there is a more accurate way of making this subtitution, but """"Queen Victoria""""! That's wrong, wrong, wrong!

Is it? Have you checked the original? I think that you will find that instead of checking, you jumped in with some more untruths. Please think instead of responding when I press your buttons.  21:50, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I notice you haven't responded to this. Have you checked the original? This is in Parliament House, and is on public didplay.  00:04, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Yes I have checked: www.foundingdocs.gov.au

""""Not found The page you requested is not available at this address."""" I suggest you check the original. I have.  00:29, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Rather than just jump in and make changes after 15 seconds thought, go back have a think for serveral days before you start adding stuff like this!. It just wastes time. Also, when you say """"Please!"""", """"Read the constitution"""", you are showing contempt for others. 
 01:02, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

When someone makes an obvious mistake like saying the literal text of the Constitution refers to the Queen of Australia, then I am quite justified in asking that person to read it.  21:50, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

If you refer to the """"literal text"""" of the Constitution you will have to concede that it contains no reference to a """"Queen of Australia,"""" and that is because the thought of Australia as a state separate from the British Empire would have been quite foreign to the men who wrote the Constitution.  01:56, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I explained the substitution logic above and applied it. Then skyring put in """"Queen Victoria"""" !!! So I reduced it to just just """"Queen"""" (ie no substiution.) I have no problem either way.  11:56, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Let's stick with the Queen, shall we? That's probably the best bet.  21:50, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I thought the point about literal text had been made, but I see that it has not been appreciated. The Constitution does not state that the Governor-General is the representative of the Queen. If you want to quote the literal text of the Constition, then by all means do so, but don't go making stuff up that you think might or should or could be in there, when it clearly isn't.  23:49, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Nowhere in the literal text of the Constitution will you find the statement """"the Governor-General is the representative of the Queen"""". Nowhere. s2 states """"A Governor-General appointed by the Queen shall be Her Majesty's representative"""". That is a clear statement of intention. I noted s101 previously, which states: """"There shall be an Inter-State Commission"""". There is not an Inter-State Commission, so clearly it is incorrect to say that the literal text of s2 means that the Governor-General is now the Queen's representative, given the example",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Re: """"Reverts"""" 

Hello, Drmargi. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank you for saying what needed to be said to me, but in a very respectful, sophisticated manner. I've taken the time to review both articles you referenced, especially personal attacks. While what I said was not directed at any specific person, it was in direct conflict with a portion of what constitutes a personal attack. For that, I'd like to apologize. The reason I verbally came out swinging, so to speak, is because of misdirected frustration. There is an individual with whom I had a conflict regarding the episode page of another show, a show about which I'm almost as passionate as I am about Person of Interest, and that very same person if one of those who reverted my edit (mind you, for good reason I now know), however, when this took place on another TV show's page, he was extremely passive aggressive and hostile in his immediate discrediting of my editing abilities. I had just started using Wikipedia at the time and was not very proficient in computational cyber protocol, or even writing code (that is not the case anymore) Please do not misinterpret this, as I know I am the one in the wrong, and I am not trying to engage in a dialogue in which I somehow look like the victim. I just feel as though I needed to explain myself, and who better with whom to do so than the one of 4 users on Wikipedia who have shown me respect and made me feel welcome.

I am well aware that the world will not end if the POI Season 5 info is not complete (lol). If I thought the world were to end, I wouldn't be on my computer. But passive aggression aside, I sincerely am a person who loves Person of Interest and Criminal Minds, as they have helped me deal with deep-seeded problems in my own life, as far-fetched as that may sound, so I make it my business to do the best I can to help keep fellow fans as informed as possible, and Wikipedia is an amazing vessel through which to do so. In my mind, I saw how many little error notices Wikipedia has put on the POI episode lists and wondered why my mistake was IMMEDIATELY centered out, but whoever made the mistakes of adding too long of an episode summary, over 40 times, was not reprimanded. However, it is foolish to assume they weren't. I reacted much in disproportion to the situation, and I do not intend to do so again, as I want to respect Wikipedia's rules. I just felt that a specific user had discredited my information for the sole purpose of undermining me. That did, in fact, happen on a page for Criminal Minds and I was the aggrieved party in that case. My information was solid, came straight from a co-executive producer, and yet this person continued reverting it, so I sought help and reported him. However, to think that same scenario applies to this POI conflict... I now see how slanted and nonsensical that is.

In conclusion, I will not add information unless it can be traced back to an original source, credible and solid. (like my addition of Fred Toye as director and Andy Callahan as co-writer of POI episode 5-10 - the 100th) I do apologize if I've offended you with my two aggressive edit summaries, as they were the result of misdirected anger and frustration. Thank you for informing me of where I went wrong, and remaining respectful and composed. I love to learn, and I'm glad I've learned more specific information about how to avoid reference/edit info-conflicts. I also want you to know that I'm well aware that Wikipedia is not a fan site. While I intend to show you the utmost respect, that was uncalled for. I can read - very well, in fact. Je peux parler en Français aussi, et je peux le comprendre. I know that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, that is why I try to be as thorough as possible, and if this sentence comes off as condescending, that is because you offended me as well. I did not insult you, or anyone specifically; what I did was make a childish, anger-driven, juvenile comparison of whoever reverted my edits to royalty, or self-appointed leaders. It was a mistake to do so, and since I'm not very good at conflict resolution - the fact that this is my best attempt to mend fences proves that - I'm going to stop now because I'm starting to argue with my own intentions. Please forgive my outburst, and be assured that it won't happen again. I will continue to help build a stronger Season 5 episode table with solid references, but I fully intend to adhere to the rules and keep my opinions of other editors to myself.

Thank you for helping me to stay informed, so that I can continue to inform fellow TV Crime Drama fans. Happy editing and thank you for your kindness and composure in this matter.

I got rid of this first paragraph for several reasons:
Capitalism is typically and generally defined as an economic system where the means of production are privately owned and operated for profit; investment, pricing, and distribution decisions are privately made rather than instituted by state control, and a free market exists for goods and services.
First, """"typically"""" and """"generally"""" are weasel words.  This definition represents RJII's point of view, and violates our neutral poiint of view.  Second, I do not agree that capitalism is an economic system; there are many scholars who argue that it is not an economic system, and an NPOV description of capitalism can't make an assertion that represents one point of view.  Third, there are non-capitalist societies where the means of production are privately owned, and some scholars argue that capitalism threatens the private ownership of capital, so again this definition is inaccurate or at best violates NPOV policy.

885715b93d590d41,"(1) I really do not want to cause anyone more work than necessary. But I can't help if someone try to suit every single article to his own fashion. You just throw out everything that does not fit to your personal view. Try to edit articles more for the reader and not for yourself. What is wrong if one sentence is not quite adequate and explicit. On the other hand I am doing my best to compose one article from the scratch and then you come and you 'ruin' almost my whole work. Who is doing fruitless work here? You're obviously to deep in the math and you can't see out anymore. Try to read one original work from an original mathematician, please. If you would have a chance, you would probably change even Gauss' work. Remember on what he had written about the estimation of the number of primes and such.
(2) I'll try to fix the table, that bothers you so much. (Just give me some time).
(3) Don't call me Rasta if you're not shure what that means or if you think I am that, if I bear similar cyber nickname, and so on )
(4) The symbol |. Sometimes you like and sometimes you don't. For instance it is more clear if we write, once we have agreed what | means, 3 | 9, than 3 divides 9. You have once said that any symbol in fact does not have much sence in math so here we go...
(5) What is wrong with Möbius function here or elsewhere. When I make a table, it is clear after that what values are, but try to 'calculate' its values from your mind. I gave the function to depict further on the whole subject. It is pointless; there is no connection that needs to be mentioned. That is you opinion, I guess. Everything is important in math, specially in a number theory. If I wouldn't use Möbius function I wouln't be able to find those two numbers 648 and 700. I guess here μ(n) is 'more' important than other arithmetic functions. That's my opinion. Furthermore, anyone interested in the moebius function can easily find the value, since all they have to do is to count the prime factors, which are already given in the table. Yes, that is true. But many readers do not know at first what μ(n) means and shows. Simply as that.
(6) I am not your student out there somewhere so we have to work for this project. You correct me and I correct you if and only if I can. I am pretty tired of writting articles which envolve math, but I like math very much. And because you know something from the math, you can give your knowledge to others and not just fixing things all around as it is going for one math test. My teachers are mathematicians themselves. Only you change these articles so much, no one else. So I can't figure that they do not understand what is written in them. Egziabeher.  17:20 Sep 25, 2002 (UTC)",0,0,0,0,0,0

And it is mischievous to describe the David Marr and Marian Wilkinson article in the Sydney Morning Herald which has been quoted (and removed several times) as a statement by """"supporters"""" of Julian Moti. Marr and Wilkinson merely point out in disinterested journalistic fashion the weaknesses in the case against him; it verges on libel to describe this as being supportive of a person you apparently have already condemned as a paedophile. Moti has never been tried; he has addressed the question of whether he has a case to answer; it was that which the Vanuatu Court of Appeal determined had not been properly established and which it remitted back to a second magistrate to reconsider. (You appear to conflate the three Vanuatu hearings into one.) Marr and Wilkinson entirely leave it, as is proper in an impartial news item, for the reader to draw his or her own conclusions as to the implications – if any – of the Australian DPP going after Moti so energetically in the political circumstances of the matter. Or do you consider that any account of the Moti affair which does not condemn Moti and applaud the Australian DPP to be """"supportive"""" of Moti? You might usefully take counsel from the truism of the criminal law that one is innocent until proven guilty, a matter which the Howard Government's minister of immigration and the DPP re-discovered, no doubt to the considerable cost of the public purse when the inevitable action for malicious prosecution and wrongful imprisonment is brought by Dr Mohamed Haneef.

accusing him of """"acting childish"""", mocking his grammer, and saying things like """"nice contradiction"""" are all uncivil comments, regardless of how he acted.  
You're attacking him as a person as well as being abusive in response to him; I think the tag is appropriate.

 Advice on editing 

I see that you have had what must be an unencouraging start to editing Wikipedia, with several articles you have created being deleted, and others replaced by redirects to existing articles. My advice to new editors is that it is best to start by making small improvements to existing articles, rather than creating new articles. That way any mistakes you make (which you will, because we all do) will be small ones, and you won't have the discouraging experience of repeatedly seeing hours of work deleted. Gradually, you will get to learn how Wikipedia works, and after a while you will know enough about what is acceptable to be able to write whole new articles without fear that they will be deleted. Over the years I have found that editors who start by making small changes to existing articles and work up from there have a far better chance of having a successful time here than those who jump right into creating new articles from the start.

 IRB members of the provisional committee 

Since no one seems to have a reliable source on when Plunkett, MacDonagh, and O'Lochlainn joined the IRB, and if it was before the Provisional Committee ceased functioning (evidently in Oct, 1914) saying the IRB held half the committee appears to be unfounded.

Unfortuntely this doesn't stop them from blanking again as I've just found out. But I guess they just don't what to talk to anyone which kind of defeats the whole purpose of a talk page. Anyway consider the matter off my worrylist D  talk

Also clicking a blue link to a users talkpage which is blank is also a big red flag. Or is it blue flag. Anyway, in this case I look through the page's edit history to find warnings. But sometimes there isn't time for searching as the user could be vandalising at a fairly fast pace, so a warning(depending on the vandalism extent) will be placed on the talk page.  talk

Wikipedia articles are not:

Propaganda or advocacy of any kind. Of course, an article can report objectively about such things, as long as an attempt is made to approach a neutral point of view. You might wish to go to Usenet or start a blog if you want to convince people of the merits of your favorite views. You can also use Wikinfo which promotes a """"sympathetic point of view"""" for every article. 

This article is adversely some ones' political movement.

The camel case appears to be the correct spelling, although the official website is inconsistent (someone should donate some webdesign to them). So for now I'd trust the Mail-Trib.

Please someone proceed to undo last edit 190.95.22.190  

 this is wrong 

chuck norris was an undefeated karate champion and joe louis was a boxer.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 71.184.71.125   

 How tall? 

Officially he's 5'10"""" but in fact he's more like 5'8"""" from what I could tell. Smells of scandal! His height is an issue because he's an inspiration for tiny little cute guys everywhere. They can live the life of massive impressive physical speciments if they can actually get away with it. Perhaps there should be an entry on people whose vision prevents them from correctly judging people's heights or reading a measuring tape.   

 Junior? 

With a few web searches I couldn't turn up any reference to his birth name including a Jr. that seemed to be independent of and more reliable than Wikipedia.  Also, in his autobiography  he says his father's name is Ray, and the genealogy link  someone has in this discussion page says it's Ray D. Norris.  Also, his father being Carlos and he being Jr. is inconsistent with him being named after his minister, which he also says in his autobiography.  So I changed it.
Also, both the cited NYT article and his book spell his brother's name Wieland.   

 Birth date issue? 

Astrodatabank.com quotes his autobiography for March 10, 1942?? Can someone source the 1940 date?   

 Family man quote is too strong 

Under Personal Life, after detailing how he had a child out of wedlock the following quote shows up:

""""Norris has always been a very loving family man""""

Which uses a People magazine article of him hugging his adult sons as evidence.

This seems to be pretty weak evidence for this assertion.

Fisrt, please use the four tilde thing ~~~~ to sign your posts. It's easier to refer to someone when there's a someone to refer to. Second, I'm not sure what is the problem. Are you saying that having children out of wedlock demeans the """"family man"""" comment? Or that hugging his son is not enough proof? I'm not sure the picture is there to provide proof for the statement (that would be OR and should be eliminated if that's the case). If you don't believe the statement then place a  tag on it and see what turns up. If you could explain more clearly what the problem is maybe I could help further. padillaH (review me)(help me)

I would rather see less content and more disambiguation and sectioning on this page, with """"Main article: ..."""" just under the heading of each section. What I don't like about this page is that it favors the set-theoretic/algebraic usage of kernel a bit too much over the other uses, such as the integral transform or statistical usages.

Although the set-theoretic usage is more general than the algebraic, it is not the case that someone trying to understand the notion in group theory or ring theory for the first time really needs the set-theoretic version. Usually, """"preimage of the neutral element"""" will do. From this point of view, kernel_(algebra) is OK, although still a bit too chatty, particularly in the """"General Case"""" section. (The """"Mal'cev algebra"""" section needs help because of the redlinks.) It also underplays the category theory notion too much compared to the universal algebra notion. Again, I think that page could be improved with better sectioning. 

Null space is very problematic. It is claimed on that page that some people use both that term and the term kernel to denote the zero set of an operator, where the latter term is used in its broadest, possibly nonlinear, sense. That coincides with the algebraic version only in the case of linear operators, i.e., linear transformations. I confess I have never seen either null space or kernel used synonymously with zero set, but have only seem the terms used in the algebraic (or in the case of kernel, set-theoretic) senses. Maybe I live in a bubble. If kernel really is used sometimes in this rather weak sense, then this page needs a brief mention of it. Again, the page Null space itself is rather unstructured. Better sectioning could probably fix it.

Hmm. That makes three times I mentioned better sectioning. Maybe I really am a Structurist.

No point in concealing the fact that oil and gas exports and petroleum price play important role in the Russian economy. However there is no point in highlighting this fact too much since it borders with spreading the myth that Russian economy is only oil and gas and nothing or almost nothing else.
Few facts:
Significant growth of oil prices started only in 2004-2005, but the Russian economy started growth (and rather large growth) well in 1999-2000. 
Russian economy is not only export. The recovery of oil and gas and other minerals was only 9% of GDP in 2011  and only 6.8% was oil and gas  (with figures not much larger in the previous years). The share of oil and gas in GDP gradually falls.
Unprocessed oil and gas takes only 45% of Russian exports. More of the rest are oil-based products and fuels, but this is considered manufacturing . So the phrase in one of the last edits about the """"oil and gas, which is the majority of Russian exports"""" is oversimplified, and certainly not correct if we speak about raw materials vs manufacturing.
Federal budget grew much faster in the last decade than oil prices . And it is not clear whether """"a five-fold increase in price of oil and gas"""" is correct description - it was four-fold increase in 2000-2011, but seven times increase in 1999-2011.
In 2008 only 23% of federal budget revenues came from exports oil and gas (customs tariffs), and 18% from taxes on petroleum and mining companies . However, when we speak about the consolidated budget (federal budget + regional budgets) the similar figures for oil and gas would be just 14% and 10% .
All this means the following:
The economic growth in the early 2000s was not very much dependent on oil and gas prices. So it is incorrect to ascribe early economic growth under Putin to petroleum prices.  
Overall, the dependence (whatever its scale) of the Russian economy on oil and gas is not Putin's invention, and the share of this sector in the Russian GDP actually is falling.
However, oil and gas money constituted a very large share of the federal (but not so consolidated) budget in the Putin era. This means that it is more correct to speak that it is not the Russian economy on the whole, but the federal budget which is dependent on oil and gas.
And a qualitative addition to the figures: Russia is a northern cold country and Russia is industrial country, which means that it needs lots of fuel for itself, but it is also a (very) resource-rich country, so no wonder that it produces much energy, have lots of facilities for that, and takes the opportunity to export abroad a lot (every country in similar conditions does that: the U.S. , Canada, Norway). This is not good or bad feature of the economy, just the fact.  Talk 
We need to revert your additions on oil and gas simply because they are not entirely correct factually, and because all the key information in more generalized and accurate form is already in the lead. But if you have proposals to make some important additions in accurate wording, let's discuss them.  Talk """,0,0,0,0,0,0

A secret government facility termed by locals as the """"Big Hole"""" was operated north of Pittsboro till around 1996. It was said the site was a virtual concrete city built several stories into the ground. The facility was actually part of the Autovon system operated under government contract by AT&T.; The site has reportedly been closed due to the introduction of the Defense Switched Network.
The clock currently in the county courthouse was a recent addition added to the courthouse. It was reportedly in the original plans of the courthouse, but for some reason was left out during its original construction.
Even though Jordan Lake is held mostly in the county's borders, county residents get very little drinking water from the lake. Most of the water is currently being sold to Cary and areas of eastern Wake County. These contracts have forced the county to purchase water from neighboring counties to guarantee sufficient supply in the county water system.

The band was formed in the February 6 2008 along with Foretance by Preston Joseph, Preston formed a band in 2007 with the same members in it except Sham Bahrin after he rest off his acting career, but the band didn’t work out well, cause the band was moving really fast, and the band members still doesn’t know how to play the instruments.

Preston searched for a name in a day, the name was suppose to be name after a japanese god of destruction but it may corrupt their religion of islam. The band later posted a few novel names in the internet, and let the worldwide people vote which is the best name, there are 6 names, Mirza took Agent To The Stars (by John Scalzi), Morning Star (by Simon Raven), and more, but there are 11 votes on Agent To The Stars, which led the band to take the name.",0,0,0,0,0,0

I think there are passages in Proudhon that read like minarchism. But there are just as many others if not more that don't.

That doesn't mean that he was never an anarchist. 

I think 'On the general idea of the revolution in the 19th century' has his fullest discussion of the state and of his version of an anarchist society. It's definitely worth reading, and is widely available in english (though unfortunately I don't think it's on the net). 

In Section IV (On the principle of authority) you can find for example:

""""We conclude without fear that the revolutionary formula should not be direct legislation, nor direct government, nor simplified government; it is no more government.""""

""""Neither monarchy, nor aristocracy, nor even democracy, where this third term implies some or other government acting in the name of the people and calling itself the people. No authority, no government, even of the people: there is the revolution.""""

Speedy deletion of Auspient\
 A tag has been placed on Auspient\ requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a company or corporation, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for companies and corporations. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.  fisto  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

It appears to be remnants of longer pieces of information standing in isolation. If anyone can work out there are two trials now in progress one which started in September 2012 at the Delhi Patiala Court heard by Mr Justice Akash Jain based on a FIR filed by the Delhi Police due to her fasting at the Delhi Jantar Mantar 6 October 2006. That trial has now completed two full days of hearings the next production warrant the 14th is set for October 30-31 2014 2 days of prosecution witnesses.
The second trial is in Imphal. So after her arrest on fresh charges March 2014 the Imphal Police pressed charges at that point a local corrupt lawyer turned up and decided that the best thing was for all charges to be dropped and Sharmila to be placed in a death tent where he desire to starve herself to death over a few weeks could be respected. The Chief Judicial Magistrate rejected his plea to dismiss all charges after 13 years of imprisonment because someone might ask why did you imprison her then and keep her in solitary if there was no case to answer. The lawyer then appealed to higher Court the District & Sessions Judge. When this Judge looked at the case he pointed out the prosecution hadn't actually submitted any evidence of any wrong doing other than suggesting that everybody knew she was on a fast to death. Given that following procedural rules of evidence in court no evidence was actually being presented just references to hearsay the Judge ruled that in the absence of positive evidence to suggest mens rea he didn't need to look into the validity of the actus reus of whether hunger striking was grounds for arrest under the attempted suicide legislation so he dismissed the charges adding that he felt the Government should take measures to preserve Sharmila's health because even if hte Prosecution hadn't bothered to present any evidence he knew she was on a hunger strike and would die without farther intervention. Subsequently the Government re-arrested Sharmila on a fresh charge of attempted suicide and appealed to the Manipur High Court to have the District & Sessions Judge's judgement overturned and for a trial to proceed. Meanwhile Sharmila is held at the JNIMS security ward (not house arrest because then she would be in her own home) on 15 day judicial remand. The last judicial remand renewal was 5th September (the next one is due on 19th September) the last hearing of the Manipur High Court regarding the judicial review of the previous case dismissal was 3 September when they sought more papers but it appears this is all to complicated for wiki editors so they have gone with what appear to be verifiable facts in no particular order which when read do not make any sense at all.

And admixture with whom, themselves? As i've said we barely have an itch on the genes in the field (we may be getting closer) and i have friends who have no recent relatives with less curly or coily hair, all black skinned black people and the oldest son has almost curly hair, while the daughters don't. Also, the straight hair i see in the tropics is like that of most mammals that live in the heat, sort of rough looking, and not smooth and oily like that of Northern Eurasians, or like Penguin feathers or whatever it is on walrusses. The fact is that there are Mountains up and down East Africa (where we originate), in Northern Africa, and in West Africa, whose populations are usually less heavily pigmented than other groups (Ethiopia is familiar) possibly because of the angle of the UV rays (like elsewhere).

 Old discussions from 2003 

Some Mormons argue that even assuming mainstream Christianity's definition of God's omnipotence and omniscience, not only can God exalt mortal man, but God must do so. 

I don't understand this sentence.  I don't know what the issue is supposed to be, to which Mormons are contributing their """"argument""""; I don't know what it means that God """"must"""" exalt mortal man.   20:54, 4 Nov 2003 (UTC)

Agreed. It is not clear what the writer meant. I have no idea who wrote it, but I'll change it.

Sorry for that very brief and very confusing statement. Where it reads, omniscience, it should have read, omnibenevolence. The idea is that the Mormon meaning of deification is supported even by mainstream Christianity's definition of God's omnipotence and omnibenevolence (in contrast to Mormonism's less literal definition of God's omnipotence). Namely, if God really is omnipotent, then God can deify mortal man...and if God really is also omnibenevolent, then not only can God deify man, but God's goodness compels God to deify man.  23:36, Nov 4, 2003 (UTC)

 Much more clear.  Thanks.  23:40, 4 Nov 2003 (UTC)

 This does raise a question for me; and since I argued with my wife today, and lost, concerning who should have the car this morning, I am in the mood to ask it.  Should """"omnipotence"""" and """"omnibenevolence"""" imply, as your argument holds, that making gods out of created beings is something that God must do, then why do you not expect that every person would be exalted?  For that matter, is God too small to exalt animals? vegetables? rocks or sand?

 Perhaps the argument assumes the same shallow and useless understanding of """"omnipotence"""" and """"omnibenevolence"""" as atheists do?  Argumentatively yourse,  21:52, 15 Dec 2003 (UTC)

 I am curious.  Being Orthodox, we believe that God's benevolence includes allowing mankind to have free will to choose holy ways or not, to work toward theosis or not.  If it is mandantory that God exalt mortal man, what does that say for what Mormons believe about free will and why it does (or doesn't) exist?  

I changed the nature of God is to become the nature of Man to the nature of God is to become united with the nature of Man.  This is an important distinction. This union of the two natures first took place in the Incarnation of Jesus Christ, when the two natures were joined in Christ's one person. God's divine nature is unfathomable, and will never be understood by us, much less become completely ours. Theosis is rather our participation in God's divine energies (as described/defined by Gregory Palamas) and union with His nature. We will still never be divine in quite the same way that God is divine; we will still always possess a human nature only, it's just that that human nature will be thoroughly healed and cleansed, and united with the divine nature. At least that's my current understanding. References available, and corrections remain most welcome. -)   06:23, 10 Dec 2003 (UTC)

 Entire sanctification 

I'm pretty sure that it is tolerable to teach """"entire sanctification"""" in the EOC; although I'm sure that it isn't a doctrine in the sense of being something necessarily believed.  Therefore, I would like to  remove the disclaimer sentence in the opening paragraph, which says """"but this is not a doctrine of Orthodoxy"""".   16:09, 24 Dec 2003 (UTC)

 The """"EOC"""" abbreviation threw me for a minute; my first assumption was """"Evangelical Orthodox Church"""", which my local parish used to be part of until not that long ago; then I realized you probably meant """"Eastern Orthodox Church"""", right? Gotta love these TLA's, especially with regard to denominations. Anyway, """"entire sanctification"""" is probably one of those teachings that isn't officially affirmed or denied by Eastern Orthodoxy, in large part because the doctrine of entire sanctification was formed in a different context and in response to different questions and answers than anything Eastern Orthodoxy has really needed to directly confront. In a similar vein, I haven't been able to get a straight answer from anyone as to what Orthodoxy thinks of semi-pelagianism; closest I've come is """"Orthodoxy deals with different questions"""" or """"Orthdoxy would pose the question differently, and then answer that other question like this"""". Coming back to entire sanctification, the closest thing to an """"official"""" position I can think of is just a story of a monk telling his abbot that he had finally """"arrived"""" and was no longer experiencing",0,0,0,0,0,0

Since these chart positions are from almost 50 years ago, I think that most of them will be documented on books. However, the European ones should be available at Hung Medien, but I'm not sure.

 Hola -) 

Hola Hahc21, vengo a pedirte ayuda, como eres el único que habla español xD. Se trata del usuario Tprg, ya le he dejado varios mensajes e incluso le dejaron una advertencia y el usuario parece no entender, se la pasa creando posibles artículos de telenovelas que ni han sido confirmadas, lo único que se sabe de cada artículo que el crea son los nombres confirmados + no hay certeza de que estás telenovelas sean transmitidas o no, pueden o no ser canceladas ¿Quién sabe?; ya ha creado estos artículos: No Abras la Puerta, La Otra (2015 telenovela), Luisana Mia (2014 telenovela), Buscando a María ,  Caleta El Sol, Chipe Libre, Mi Querido Dilema. Hace días hizo una recreación de artículos borrados como Mi Corazón es Tuyo y Hasta el Fin del Mundo, que otro bibliotecario le borró, esto es algo ya cansante, no se puede estar abriendo una consulta de borrado para cada artículo que este usuario crea. Por eso pido que se tome esto en cuenta, lo único que hace es ignorar los mensajes que se les deja, y yo no pienso seguir dejandoles mensajes. Saludos y gracias ).  TALK2ME

Oh please. My sole argument with him was on the content boardwhere, if you'd note, I agreed with what he was saying, just not the manner in which he was saying it.

 Farting 

I reverted this article back to a recent version that contained the term fart. Wikipedia is a general encyclopedia (not a medical one), and its important to use a term that a majority of people know. Flatulence is no more or less a """"proper"""" term than farting is, and its definetly not slang  its use is too common, everyday, and widespread. It would be a misservice the readers to simply ignore this important term. Its such a odd thing to want to sensor.
  
I agree. Why use the word """"flatus"""" all over the place? People don't know it's fart. Doctors know it's fart, and, well, doctors are people, but they ain't most people. The common term is fart or gas.  —   | Talk 
The reason seems pretty obvious to me: """"fart"""" is a much rougher, less """"refined"""" word. Using it casually is simply not appropriate tone for an encyclopedia. -  (Talk at me) 

 Citations needed 

Oh come on, not EVERY sentence needs a citation now, does it.. It makes articles really hard to read and is just silly. I am talking about the section """"Dietary"""" where every second word has a citation or """"citation needed"""". Whoever posted all that is obsessed with citations. seriously!217.231.205.126  
I agree, especially since the rest of the article doesn't seem to conform to the extreme citation standards in the Dietary section. Additionally, some of the stuff is a given and doesn't really need a citation unless you happen to be an alien from another planet who is completely unfamiliar with Earth, in which case it remains a mystery how this alien learned enough english to understand this article without learning some basic information about humans and Earth. Not everyone is a wikipedia administrator, y'know. 74.56.36.34  

 ICD infobox 

Why is this article topped by a medical infobox? In the vast majority of occurances, flatulence has nothing to do with either disease or dysfunction.

Controversy flaw
JBL using racial slurs isn't actually controversial. It's part of his gimmick. It shouldn't be part of the controversy section.  

JBL's racial slurs as part of his gimmick are controversial.  Just because they're scripted does not make them non-controversal.  Further, JBL's comments are controversal just as the Cryme Tyme gimick has been controversial, too.

The controversial section needs some cleaning up. Where's the objectivity? Most of it assumes him as racist by making no dissemination between his personal beliefs, and his gimmick.

i'm gonna clean up the last paragraph in the 2006 section, as it is written with alot of broken english that is difficult to understand.

 Judgment Day 
should it be noted under a trivia uestion that the last 3 years in a row JBL was in a main event match for a world title at Judgement day (04 he faced Eddie Guerrero, 05 he faced John Cena, and in 06 he faced Rey Mysterio)

 Anyone know the date of his WWF debut? 
The best I can find is December 1995 as John Hawk against Savio Vega (http://www.angelfire.com/wrestling/cawthon777/95.htm). Is that right.@ 

 Nicknames 
Should a section be added with """"Wrestling God"""" put there? I'm not sure if he's had any other nicknames or if it's notable enough. But it would seem so, other articles (see Triple H) list them.  
I don't think we should. Triple H has had multiple nicknames, 3 of which he still uses. Layfield used only that one, he used it sparingly, he was almost never called """"Wrestling God"""" by other superstars or commentators, and he has not used it in years. ( )

 Powerbomb?

He did not wrestle though, he helped beat up Coach and Carlito. The match was just Hornswoggle vs. Coach and Carlito (it was no DQ, thats why the APA could interfere).  Spyke 
WWE.com announced his in-ring return.   

 Return To Active Duty 
It seems we've been entertaining a bit of looking into the crystal ball, here. JBL returns tonight on Smackdown, but until that show airs, it's not official unless it's properly referenced somewhere else (WWE.com or another reliable source).   

 Well this ultimately proved to be false... 
In """"Semi-Retirement / WWE Commentator (2006-2007)""""...

""""Layfield noted in a recent commentary on TheStreet.com that he was retiring from in-ring competition for good...""""

""""A broken back suffered in a match in England, compounded by a herniated and bulged disc, finally made me realize my career as a professional wrestler was over.""""

The focus of the animation is the CMYK model, which is a mathematical abstraction, and not the device dependency of any particular print process. I consider it helpful in the same way as the animations at the articles RGB color space and YCbCr are in explaining a 3-D volume that can be difficult to visualize from a static drawing.
 We cannot show subtractive ink colors accurately but that does not mean the article cannot have diagrams. The colors I used are the same as here and here i.e. 125 colors uniformly filling the displayable range and mapped to the CMK space. Note: this is not perfect, there is no gamma correction and linearity is assumed. If anyone likes to propose a different colour law in terms of 24-bit RGB shades, I can see about putting them in the animation.
 Just noticing that it is a spinning object tells the viewer it is something in 3-D. It helps to notice that the cube rotates about its diagonal which is the K axis. Then one understands the geometry.
 The goal is to give a qualitative visualization of how ink densities are coordinated like dimensions of a space. a) In principle three inks can define the whole gamut which is therefore a cube. The article explains that black ink is added to """"save money on ink"""" and to address the inadequacy of affordable CMK inks in very dark tones.

I think it is a forlorn expectation that any Wikipedia diagram can provide colorimetrically accurate color swatches. It is correct to show that the CMK trio of subtractive inks work, to a good first approximation, as orthogonal variables that define a color space.

ECHR referenced three decisions on its verdict: 
a. In November 2007, The Spanish Constitutional Court had found unconstitutional the offence of negation and had taken the view that
the mere negation of a crime of genocide did not constitute direct incitement to violence. 
b. In February 2012, the French Constitutional Council had declared unconstitutional a law which made it a criminal offence to deny the existence of the genocides recognised by the law, finding it to be incompatible with freedom of expression and freedom of research. 
c. The United Nations Human Rights Committee had expressed its conviction that “[l]aws that penalize[d] the expression of opinions about historical facts [were] incompatible with the obligations that the Covenant [on Civil and Political Rights] impose[d] on States parties ...” and that the “Covenant [did] not permit general prohibition of expressions of an erroneous opinion or an incorrect interpretation of past events”.ECHR ECHR punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide (Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""").

89d81c929bdc173a,"Cornea Transplant Surgery

An eye is considered to be one of the most important part of the human body. Eyes are organs that perceive light and forms a communication with the brain providing all the necessary data. The brain then processes the raw data and acts accordingly. An eye is a complex component of the human body comprising of various and sensitive minute parts. A transparent front part of the eye that acts a protection shield for the iris and pupil is cornea. Sensitivity, transparency and presence of immune cells make cornea a very special tissue. Cornea transplant surgery is an operational method in which a damaged cornea is replaced by donated corneal tissue. It is very much admissible to consult a trained cornea surgeon in India and expert for successful cornea transplant surgeries. 

Corneal Transplantation

Corneal transplantation surgery, a process in which damaged corneal tissues are replaced, is also referred to as corneal transplant. It is one of the most successful organ transplantation surgeries in the world. Replacement of cornea can restore completely or partially lost vision, reduce pain and improve the efficiency of cornea. Also known as keratoplasty, the transplantation surgery is considered as successful sight saving operation for improves the optical quality of cornea. Some of the conditions that might require cornea transplantation include malfunctioning of cornea’s inner layers, keratoconus (bulging or change in shape of cornea), swelling in cornea and tissue growth in cornea. Occasionally corneal transplantation surgery is combined with various refractive surgeries, cataract surgeries and many such surgeries. Owing to technological developments and medical advancements, the number of corneal transplantation surgeries in India has increased subsequently providing sustained protection from cornea diseases.        

Donor Corneal Tissue

Corneal transplantation includes replacement of damaged or diseased cornea by donor corneal tissue. A thorough evaluation of donor cornea is essential for the success of corneal transplantation surgery. Due to latest inventions in the field of medical science, today a single donor cornea is divided into 3 parts and is used in different patients for improving visual acuity. Detailed screening of human donor cornea during transplantation of cornea ensures successful transplantation surgery. However there are many risks involved in the surgery. These risks are relatively very small but they can cause hazardous effects if the surgery is not done under proper care. Some complications that could occur are bleeding, eye infection, increased sensitivity to light, rejection of new cornea, increased redness of the eye and many such dangerous complications. Hence it is always advisable to consult a cornea disease treatment specialist for successful treatment of cornea disorders.

First thing you need to know, is that Good Article status is a crock of shit. The criteria for it is a fair model, and it is not the problem. The problem is that it is not governed by a committee. Any bozo, like yourself, is allowed to review an article and ultimately decide if the article, in their mind, merits inclusion into CGD (Club Green Dot). The bar sits firmly in the mud. Snakes slither across it. My articles, on the other hand, never have enjoyed the benefits of exception. With extreme prejudice, they have been held to the highest possible standard set by the criteria.

Now we get to your GA review of Howling Bells, which I would like a full explanation for. That's one of the agreements that I have set forth, in order for you to avoid failure of your articles, by me. You can decide if you would like to abide by this resolution or not. Tell me something, are you on drugs, prescription or otherwise? If that offends you I apologize, but your review made me think of three things. Either somebody took a shit on your face and you couldn't see through it, you had a big D in your ass, or you were in a state of incoherence brought on by substance abuse. I must confess, I'm ashamed that I'm even having to talk to some punk ass high school kid who listens to crappy music. Not that I feel that I hold a higher place in this world than you, because Lord knows that's not the case. It's just that, I'm sittin' here having to deal with some goddamn little kid over the computer. Even at your age, I know you understand where I'm coming from.

There's not much of a reward getting an article to GA status, aside from that dot. A small part of me would like to see the article at GA, but it really doesn't concern me a whole lot whether it gets there or not. Howling Bells is at GA and that's basically good enough for me. As far as Halfway Gone goes, at this point, it's outta my hands. You're just gonna have to accept the fact the article could possibly be de-listed. Consider that your penalty for fuckin' around with other people's hard work.

Ok, so there are two agreements I have come up with that I think are very acceptable.

A full explanation of your GA review of Howling Bells (album). I'll guide you through it on the review page. If you decide to play ball, good on ya.
You must say the following to me, here on my talk page: I, , am just a punk ass teenager, who loves Justin Beiber, loves the crappy music of Justin Beiber, and loves crappy music from many other crappy artists.
The font has to be huge too, none of this small crap. Also, see if you can do it in some kind of color, that would be cool.

Now, I will not pass your articles if you agree to this, but I will not fail them. Instead, I will explain on the review pages that any reviewing of the articles that I have done up until this point should be disregarded. My reasoning will be because of my inexperience as a first time reviewer has led me to realize that I am not capable for such a task. I will wash my hands of the articles, take them off hold, and request that another editor undertake the review. If you are unwilling to accept these agreements, than you leave me no other choice but to expeditiously fail the articles. Let me know what you wanna do kid.  (meow)",1,0,0,0,0,0

Disruptive editing
In my view the collaborative editing team working to make this a FA has shown extreme tolerance in accommodating the concerns of User:Skipsievert. This latest """"tagging"""" follows a full consideration and resolution of COI issues on the appropriate noticeboard. Repeated editing of resolved or previously discussed issues is part of the pattern of disruptive editing. Below is part of the content of the WP entry on disruptive editing:

How disruptive editors evade detection 

Disruptive editing already violates site policy, yet certain editors have succeeded in disrupting articles and evading disciplinary action for one of several possible reasons:

 their edits occur over a long period of time; in this case, no single edit may be clearly disruptive, but the overall pattern is disruptive
 their edits are largely confined to talk-pages, such disruption may not directly harm an article, but it often prevents other editors from reaching consensus on how to improve an article
 their edits often avoid gross breaches of civility, especially by refraining from personal attacks, even though they interfere with civil and collaborative editing meant to improve the article
 their edits remain limited to a small number of pages that very few people watch
 conversely, their edits may be distributed over a wide range of articles that few people watch.

 Signs of disruptive editing 

This guideline concerns gross, obvious and repeated violations of fundamental policies, not subtle questions about which reasonable people may disagree.

A disruptive editor is an editor who:

 Is tendentious: continues editing an article or group of articles in pursuit of a certain point for an extended time despite opposition from one or more other editors. Tendentious editing does not consist only of adding material; some tendentious editors engage in disruptive deletions as well.
 Cannot satisfy Wikipedia:Verifiability; fails to cite sources, cites unencyclopedic sources, misrepresents reliable sources, or manufactures original research.
 Engages in """"disruptive cite-tagging""""; adds unjustified  tags to an article when the content tagged is already sourced, uses such tags to suggest that properly sourced article content is questionable.
 Does not engage in consensus building:
 repeatedly disregards other editors' questions or requests for explanations concerning edits or objections to edits;
 repeatedly disregards other editors' explanations for their edits.
 Rejects community input: resists moderation and/or requests for comment, continuing to edit in pursuit of a certain point despite an opposing consensus from impartial editors.
In addition, such editors may:
 Campaign to drive away productive contributors''': act in spite of policies and guidelines such as Wikipedia:Civility, Wikipedia:No personal attacks, Wikipedia:Ownership of articles, engage in sockpuppetry/meatpuppetry, etc. on a low level that might not exhaust the general community's patience, but that operates toward an end of exhausting the patience of productive rules-abiding editors on certain articles.

Refusal to 'get the point'

In some cases, editors have perpetuated disputes by sticking to an allegation or viewpoint long after the consensus of the community has rejected it, repeating it almost without end, and refusing to acknowledge others' input or their own error. Often such editors are continuing to base future attacks and edits upon the rejected statement. Such an action is disruptive to Wikipedia. Thinking one has a valid point does not confer the right to act like it is an accepted rule when it is not.

The editing team has expressed the view that reasonable verified and substantiated requests will be given full consideration. However, IMO the recent spate of """"refusing to get to the point"""", repeated """"tagging"""" total disengagement with """"consensus building"""", """"ignoring of requests for explanations"""", """"ignoring moderator suggestions"""", """"rapid negative engagement with new contributors"""" all spell out the pattern of disruptive editing that has long-delayed completion of this collective effort, and it deserves disciplinary action.

 Official Notice 

I am posting this here, per WP:ADMINABUSE, as evidence that I have taken the step of attempting to resolve the situation by talking directly with the administrator in question. I have been here just under 2 months. I have made well over 1000 good contributions to this project, and until this incident, enjoyed my time here very much. This has been a nightmare, and I very much wish to put it behind me. However, as a matter of principle, I feel I must continue to do what I feel is right, even though it would be much easier to just drop this, and even though I have very little chance of ultimate success. I realize that to err is human. I'm not looking for your head on a platter. I'm not even looking for an apology. I too, am human, and far from perfect. In the time since the incident, I have not conducted myself in the most appropriate manner. The fact is, that while I may very well owe an explanation, and/or apology for some of it, it has nothing to do with the original block. You mentioned the fact that several other administrators declined to unblock me. Without veering off into another topic, as far as why that is only partly true, the fact is that this is not about what any other administrator has or hasn't done. You were the one who blocked me, and it is only you from whom I can request accountability. In earlier comments, you've made it quite clear that you are willing to be held accountable before your fellow administrators. I however, am asking that hold yourself accountable for your actions to me; the common user, who was affected by a decision that you made. It remains my position, as I have said before, that I did not deserve to be blocked. You blocked me for violating WP:3RR. 3RR clearly states that the removal of BLP violations is an exception to the rule. Furthermore, you stated on my talk page, that I """"should have stopped reverting, and attempted to gain consensus"""" on the talk page. WP:BLP states that violations """"should be removed immediately, without waiting for discussion."""" My actions were in line with WP:BLP, and did not violate WP:3RR. Therefore, I am formally, and respectfully, asking that you acknoweledge that although acting in good faith, you erred in judgement when you blocked me. I thank you for your time, and await your response.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

The first question that is important for me is the accuracy of the first block about """"tendentious"""" edits in Macedonian Muslims. An administrator with particilar POV om Macedonian question, without warning blocked an editor (i.e. me) with a contrary POV. (Nevertheless that until this moment the administrator didn't made some edits in the concrete article).Then this disputable blocking is an argument against me.
The second problem is why some of the other administrators denied to look profoundly: The only caution by some other editor after my first blocking, until I stop my edits in the article is this - with a very """"substantial"""" argument: """"Stop wasting everybodys time!"""".

Aha! So Kayla and Kailina are the same; but there's more to be explained. After checking some more sources I think we can be sure of the existence of at least two separate Agaw dialects/languages (just like Bender 1976:8 says; but unlike Ethnologue and Sommer 1992): first, Qemant-Kemant-Chemant-Kamant-Kimantinya-Kimanteney, and secondly Kayla-Kaila-Kailinya (ethnonym Betə Israel (cf. Mann & Dalby 1987:16), xenonyms Falasha/Felasha from Ge'ez 'immigrant, stranger'; Yihudi (cf. Ethnologue 1992 as cited in Sommer 1992). Kemant could be extinct by now (Sommer 1992 mentions that """"according to Gamst, Kemant is threatened by extinction""""). In any case, a huge language shift is going on here; all speakers are bilingual in Amharic and according to Ethnologue, only 1650 native speakers of Kemant were left, out of an ethnic group of about 170,000 people in 1998. Endangered, to say the least.
Quirin (1998) leads me to believe that an important reason for Qemant and Kayla being separate languages is that their speakers (coming from a common Agaw base) developed separate identities from the beginning of the 14th century on. However, apparently there's a lot of fuss going on in Beta Israel historiography (cf. e.g. ) and I don't know enough about it at present to judge sources like this (though Qurin seems to have done his homework).
Anyway, a third dialect seems to be Qwera/Quara/Qwarina/'Kara of Kwarasa'/Hwara/Hwarasa; this one appears to be extinct (cf. Ethnologue). It seems to have been related more closely to Qemant — Gamst (p.c. to Sommer, Sommer 1992:358) proposes that """"Quara, Quarinya, spoken by a few Falasha in Quara (to the west of Qemant-land), is nearly the same language as Qemant.""""

Hence the other component, which represents the velocity of the particle relative to the rotating frame, must be radial.

I've extended your block to a week, because I think 24 hours is too lenient here.

Your actions have shown contempt for consensus and the community in a manner that I've almost never seen before. That you did this at ITN, where things are so much more laid back than in many parts of the project, makes this abuse even more shocking, which is the reason I've extended your block. I will say the following once, and once only: if you ever particiapte in the same discussion on Wikipedia under two identities, logged in or not, in an attempt to stack votes, I will block you indeifnitely and make a motion for a community ban. If I were you, I would be spending the next week reflecting on how I could regain the trust of the community, but if you attempt to evade this block, you will be met with equally stiff sanctions.  | Penny for your thoughts?

Oh I have gone ahead and done this. I think that page can be deleted now. There wasn't much on it. I hope you are happy with the way things are set out now. 

About the structure of the article generally, I have a few points:

I think that there should be a section for each daughter section, and that this should pretty much just be a quick rundown of that page, of the important parts in that page.
The 'research into health benefits' should be moved to the third party page, and only one study mentioned briefly on the main pagethe one that appeared in a journal, the other maybe should not be mentioned. Does not warrant a section to itself, at any rate. (will just go ahead and do this now)
Take out epoch times section. It is related to Falun Gong, but it is not of the same nature as the other sections, like beliefs and teachings, falun gong overseas, persecution etc.. There can be some 'related pages' mention of it, I think that would be appropriate, but basically it is not specifically a part of the Falun Gong cycle of articles, though related to them.

Knowning that Lawrence was hit changes a lot, though; before Gray's report, I think the general assumption was that only the real big cities were hit. If Lawrence was hit, though, that means a hundred other smaller cities across the U.S. could also have been targets.
Not to launch into too much speculation here, but that opens up some interesting possibilities. If the people of Jericho could see a mushroom cloud over Denver, then they would surely see one over Colorado Springs (the home of NORAD) and Pueblo. Wichita (which is about as far from Jericho as Denver is) might also have been a target, since its population is more than three times that of Lawrence. As has been mentioned before, Denver is not visible from western Colorado (nor are there any real mountains anywhere in the vicinity). If the bad guys unleashed Tsar Bomba upon the city of Denver, then maybe, but Gray said the NYC bomb they intercepted was only 20 kilotons.
A possible answer to this is that the mushroom cloud seen in the first episode could have been over one of the smaller cities closer to the Kansas border, say Limon or Sterling. There are no towns between Denver and Kansas that have a population of more than fifty or sixty thousand. But if Lawrence was hit....
It seems like those in Jericho would be able to visually estimate the distance, though, so I'm more inclined to chalk it up to """"hey, it's just a tv show!"""". But it does remind us that the people of Jericho (and we at home) don't know anything for sure, which is one thing that seems pretty realistically done in the show.

Hi. Hope (and trust) the weather is a bit better where you are. Several things:
the 0.5 plus images has been grabbed and put up here: http://wikipedia-release-version-0.5.fixedreference.org/ and our 2007 list (which is much longer) is at

Also to let you know about Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/2006_Wikipedia_CD_Selection. The current marginal majority to move the page to Wikipedia space. This makes some sense but practically far fewer people will ever see the CD releases if we always put them in project place (the internal search on Wikipedia excludes project pages) and I think there is enough notability now to make the case... talk",0,0,0,0,0,0

 notability and sourcing 
Dear 74

thank you for your answer. I really appreciate the way you propose to communicate as it gives more comfort for both of us and builds dialog and consensus.

Thank you for your suggestions on how to improve this article. I agree with them but I think I should first follow Fiddle Faddle's suggestion """"that the first task is to show and prove notability though""""

I fully understand and agree with wikipedia rules - thanks to which the quality of articles is high and I want to follow that. This is why I prepared (it took a lot of my time - believe me) a detailed info proving notability and the fact that I mostly use secondary sources (It's available here  Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/SORCER). Unfortunately, till now from those who have doubts on notability and sources - there was no single comment showing directly what in their opinion is not enough within presented proves.

So as I appreciate our way of communication I would like to ask you for your opinion about the proves of notability and sourcing which I have provided here: Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/SORCER. I encourage you to read all of it but if you would like to focus on proves only - they are listed with following dates/signatures:
Pawelpacewicz (talk) 
Pawelpacewicz (talk) 

Additionally in Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/SORCER you can find opinions of 2 members who are specializing in computing:
User:Scope creep who is member of WikiProject Computer science. He reviewed one of sources and confirmed it's secondary source
User:W Nowicki who is member of WikiProject Computing - gave """"keep"""" vote
I hope You find them useful.

Oh and, where did you get the """"insult Wikipedia readers and editors"""" from? Are you some kind of automatically self-offended dude? You seem to think everything is offensive. How is a source, offensive? How does a website, having opinions critical of Jewish behaviour, fail WP:RS?

Wow, that was really funny. Anyway, MacDonald has been attacked several times by American Jews for allegedly being """"antisemite"""" (you know, that awesome word which has any actual academic value beside shutting down legitimate criticism of Jews). This, for instance, in FrontPageMag by Jacob Laksin. He has come under a lot of heat from the SPLC, which I'm sure you're already aware of. Now, recently, the SPLC has been pushing to get him dissociated from his university. All this, has that rense source (which you, eloquently, call """"antisemitic claptrap"""") covered. I don't see the problem here. It seems to me, you dismiss this rense source as a WP:RS, not because of any false writings, but because, there are opinions you dislike and deem, """"insulting"""". —  (Discussion · contribs) 
Dude, the term """"antisemite"""" has no actual academic value beside shutting down legitimate criticism of Jews? Do me a favor, please don't discuss anything with me regarding your views on theis subject and stick SOLELY to discussion of editing and improving this artcile, because your views are simply too offensive and abhorrent to have to volunarily subject myself to. By the way, I edited the entry to reflect what the College newspaper actually reports, which is that the moves against Macdonald are a result of opposition from school faculty. Despite the fact that bigots like rense like to whine about how evil Jews are persecuting antisemites like Macdonald, I'm afraid the professor has only himself to blame.   
Sorry, but I'm not here to appease your """"getting offended"""" radar. If you feel offended every single time someone is critical of Jews, such as Kevin MacDonald, you have a serious emotional problem, or, you're probably Jewish. MacDonald has himself to blame? Wrong. MacDonald has written three scholarly books on Jews, Judaism, and Jewish political movements. That's his right to do so if he wants to and he should not get into trouble because of it, since, last I checked, the 1st amendment was still valid in America (or so they say). What next? You want to criminalise political criticism of Jews too? Anyway, this is what the source states:

I collect swords and throwing stars
'Cause I'm a weeaboo

But I will always be one step ahead of you

I haven't showered in like 16 weeks
All my friends and peers are ashamed of me

 Why will Gwen Gale not read the sources? 

On 01:27, 5 August 2010 I posted a section on """"Talk: Death of Adolf Hitler"""" titled “Random Questions” which started “I am not a scholar, I read Wiki but would not think of editing it. But I was disappointed in this article, and many points in the discussion, so I am asking some questions. Perhaps someone else will read and address them.” The section went on with several rethoritical questions, and ended with “As to sources, the last books I have read are The Murder of Adolph Hitler by Hugh Thomas (sort of shaky) and The Last Days of Hitler by Anton Joachimsthaler (English translation, I buy much of this).”

Gwen Gale was apparently assigned me as an administrator, because at  she replied with: ”As the article lead says,...This said, this talk page isn't a forum for talking about personal views or questions on a topic, it's meant for talking about sources and how to echo them in the text. I say this because the article seems to already cover, with thorough citations, most if not all of what you've brought up...dodgy. Gwen Gale (talk)”

By this reply it appears that Gwen Gale is NOT FAMILIAR with the work of Joachimsthaler, who I have just referenced, and thinks that I am asking a personal question, not a rhetorical one. At that time I apologized, tried to explain myself, and restate my questions.

At  I posted” If I had read Kershaw's Nemesis Chapter 17 note 156 and Epilogue note 1 I wouldn't have wasted your time. You can't get much clearer than that. Should be required reading. Perhaps someone else should read them, and possibly edit the article. Thank you for your time.99.41.251.5 (talk)”

At  I posted “I would like to direct people to the work of Ian Kershaw Hitler, 1939-1945: Nemesis ISBN 0393322521. Chapter 17 and the epilogue relate to this article. Please pay attention to his notes and sources. Be warned, his book Hitler: a Biography is a kind of digest which does not include these resources....The source Joachimsthaler is basically an English translation of a German's analysis of 1950's post-Soviet interviews of bunker survivors. The original transcripts must be available somewhere. There are many other bunker interviews, some with questionable intent, and not all agree. Wm5200 (talk)“

Since those posts I have posted a huge amount on the talk page, virtually all of which Gwen Gale has disputed. Much of the material I have posted I have later deleted, often because I felt that the endless conflict between Gwen Gale and myself is counterproductive to the article.

Anyone who is Wiki can probably bring back any of those posts. Was I sometimes rude and argumentative? Absolutely. Was I making legitimate points which related to the article? I thought so. Did I receive effective support and encouragement by my administrator? I think not, but you judge.

My main point was that Joachimsthaler had reviewed the information, and had made a solid case for positions which Kershaw backed. I repeatedly begged anyone, especially Gwen Gale, to read Joachimsthaler and Kershaw, specifically, two footnotes, I even told the pages of the footnotes. Gwen Gale clearly had not read either source.

 I posted, under the heading “Question for Gwen Gale” , the following: ”I lost you, but I’m confused myself. It appears as though the person with the least information available is most influential on the article.

The U.S. is big on free press, and it works. My very low budget suburb is in a system which serves 225,000 people with 4 MILLION titles (numbers approximate, thanks Carol). That’s on the next shuttle van. Most of the rest of the assets of a state with 12 million people are a couple of days away by mail. The specialty stuff on AE from Radcliffe took maybe a week. And I am an amateur. Dan, you are over three million people higher in the food chain, you must be “world class”. Kierzek has clearly read and analyzed everything, reviewed most of it, and as far as I can tell, every word he says is accurate and informed.

Kershaw, Joachimsthaler, Thomas, Trevor-Roper, Beevor, Shirer, Ryan, Toland, Eberle/Uhl, Lehmann/Carroll, O’Donnell, Victor, Petrova/Watson. (Vinogradov hit a snag, reordered). These are books which I have had in my possession and read parts of since Aug 2010. I can understand if others do not have access to the same resources, but I think that should be addressed. If someone does not have access to two footnotes which are critical in a discussion, that also should be addressed...I know that this is P.O.V., and that I am personally involved. But I can not help but believe that this article has problems with it’s process.Wm5200 (talk)'""""

Great sentiment, but the rules and policies are, in many cases, inherently, explicitly bad. If they were fundamentally sound, they wouldn't yield such preposterous results they so often do, particularly on political/economics articles. Believe it or not, but I've actually try to edit within those flaws, and it doesn't work. 

OR is one of my favorites. You can add completely relevant, well-sourced text with great informative value, but are explicitly prohibited from doing so, and are thus unable to correct a distorted rendition on a given topic. When editing so called fringe articles, this becomes almost comical. Since fringe by its very definition means that it is outside what is considered mainstream, it is easy to find mainstream articles that criticizes the fringe position, but nigh on impossible to find a mainstream source that counters that position, since the mainstream by and large is critical of that position. So you need to find an article that explicitly counters the (arbitrary chosen) article used by the mainstream editor. Obviously that will be very difficult, since fringe articles are, again, by its very definition, scarce. And if you do find one, the mainstream editor calls on the RS rule, thus ruling out the use of that source because, and here's the kicker, its fringe. And there is nothing you can do about it, because that is what the rules say. Talk about catch 22.

Thus you can add whatever demonstrably false bullshit you want in order to inflate the criticism of the fringe position. This easy to do, since there's an endless amount of mainstream articles to choose from. These criticisms become virtually impossible to counter because of the OR, RS or some other bullshit rule. According to the rules, it is better to have false and distortive information on the article (provided it is critical) than correct and informative material. This is not the consequence of some manipulation of otherwise good rules and policies, this is the explicit goal and purpose of WP. Truth is not an issue, the High Lord Jimmy Wales tells us, only whatever delusional, bullshit claims that can be """"verified"""" by delusional, bullshit mainstream sources.

I've got blocked many times, that is true. But why I have got blocked? Well, in most cases it's the result of me trying to defend an article against what any sensible person would have to call vandalism. But of course, vandalism is just keeping with rules and policies in the WP world. Also, if you happen to be alone in defending a certain edit, and you have two opponents, they can just take turns reverting your edit until you hit the 3rr rule. Another charming aspect of the WP rules and policies.

So no, the rules and policies are not mostly okay. Very far from it. They are the very reason why WP cannot be used as source on information about economics, not even in a youtube commentary debate. It works fine when it comes to physics or other natural sciences. But not when it comes to economics. That is a shame, but it is the inevitable consequence of fundamentally flawed rules and policies and the implementation thereof. I may not have been around as long as you have, but I've been around long enough to know how fucked up WP's rules and policies are. And they are holding WP back.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

http://www.chainsofreason.org/wiki/Chains_of_Reason:Create_a_new_chain

I think this is a great improvement, so thanks for the suggestion. However, as you will see on the above page, users still have to work-out for themselves what number they should give a new chain. And if it is not a recycled number, then they have to first add the new chain title to the top of the list at the bottom of the page, so it would be good to be able to also automate this process of determining what number to give a new chain, taking into account the need to recycle the titles of any deleted chains.

Hello, Ghatch. A request has been made at Wikipedia:Changing username/Usurpations to usurp, or """"take over"""", your username because another user would like to use it to edit. The changing username guideline allows a username that is not being actively used to be usurped if the user is given an opportunity to object and does not do so. 

If you have an email set in your preferences, you should be getting an email from a bureaucrat or changing username clerk explaining how to consent or object to this process. 

If you do not object to being renamed to a new username in order for another user to use the name you currently have, please log in and post a reply here saying so (you may also tell us what username you would like to be renamed to, or we will provide you with a generic one). 

If you do nothing: the request may be filled shortly, and your account will be moved to a generic username. You may request that it be moved to a new username of your choice at any time.

If you object to being renamed: please log in and make an edit to this page clearly stating that you object to usurpation. Any objection on your part will prevent usurpation.

Please note that even if your current username is usurped, you can still edit and your data will not be lost; your preferences, watchlist, and other user settings will be transferred to a new username.

I am a plastic surgeon and treat up to 8 gynecomastia patients a day from around the world.  I have been dealing with helping the public learn about this condition for now more than 30 years.

Dealing with so many gynecomastia patients, it is hard to express their frustration with the public just not understanding the problem.  The anger is intense and most cannot express themselves why they feel so stressed out about their problem.  I put a video of a particularly eloquent patient describing his living with gynecomastia up to help family and others understand the Emotion Behind Gynecomastia.  Unfortunately there is noting like hearing the stress in the human voice to emphasize the emotional component, it would have been nice to show the face, but then I would not have been permitted to share his experience.  I added it as a reference as I thought it was the best way to show that such details were available to those trying to deal with this problem.

Public phrases like those listed puffy nips also include """"bitch tits"""" but I did not know if that was permitted here.  So many just do not recognize gynecomastia but the lay phases added.

Non-surgical compression garments have been a major source of stress relief for those waiting  to see if their gynecomastia would resolve on its own, or were dealing with losing weight, or just could not afford surgery.  This link is to examples of how effective / not effective garments can be for real life sufferers of gynecomastia.  Fat people still look fat but the bouncing is stabilized.  Many have told me of the differences the garments have made their lives.  The parents of one 14 year old child from Trinidad told me he was a different person just from use of the garment while waiting the year his endocrinologist wanted for his medical condition to stabilize.  The actual surgery made a greater difference.

Gynecomastia comes in so many differnt forms that the limited pictures just does not tell the story well at all. The Gynecomastia Gallery link is a much more comprehensive method of demonstrating the problem.

Hope the additions were according to form.

Biased Viewponit

Just reading this article I've noticed that it fails to mention many of the controversies of cityrail, accusations of sexual harrassment within its staff, chronicle delays, major incidents (such as the breakdown in transport following Queen Mary II etc). When it does mention criticism of CityRail it almost invariably provies (and in many cases gives emphasis to) a counterargument, particularly when the section dedicated to criticism is called """"Challenges"""" and portrays CityRail as being able to best them in all situations.

The way I see it the article reads more as a commercial advertisement, fails to mention many controversial issues surrounding CityRail, and continually praises the corporation through colourful language. This may be just me, but at least add in information about accusations relating to sexism and harrassment in the working culture, public scrutiny of services etc

I am not sure where to post, so posting here.  There is much misinformation and lack of proper information on the page Weapons of the Vietnam War.  One example specifically is Weapons.  The Swedish K sub machine gun was not only used by Navy SEALs but also Special Forces (Green Berets). ARVN were not armed with the Swedish K but M-l carbines.  The entire article is full of errors and lacking information.  I have not the time to edit and cite the page.  I hope you are able to find a reliable source to clean up the page.

asssiveego has posted his RfA and I have blocked him for it

Hello. I have blocked Masssiveego for his antics on Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Masssiveego which seems like a clear attempt to draw fire from people bitter with his own antics on RfA, with a minimalist nomination and tongue-in-cheek answers to the questions. He seems to have induced a bite from Pschemp at least. This lasts for a week. I previously did this for Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/The Mad Bomber for trolling his own RfA.

    Good call  Samir धर्म 

        I don't see any issues with this block. Pure WP:POINT. Can we close the RfA? (Or does it need to be a 'crat?) alphaChimp laudare 

I was thinking of blocking him myself, so obviously I endorse the block. It's rather obvious that he's trolling for attention with all this RfA stuff... let's just not feed him and move on. W.marsh

[edit]

Exhausting community patience?

Once again, it's time to bring this up. He's coming close to exhausting the community's patience, in my view. Thoughts? – Chacor 

    Not yet. I would not have blocked him at all for starting the RfA. In fact i think SNOWing this RfA was a bad idea. Rather I would have let it run the full 7 days. Having 100+ opposes might have finally gotten through to this editor that he needs to reconsider his approach. But with the RfA snowed, he's got ammo to say we aren't treating him right, etc. ++Lar: t/c 

        Perhaps, but there just isn't a reason to let trolls stay. – Chacor 

            Is this user a flat out troll? Sure, close the book right away... Or, is he rescuable? if rescuable is it worth the effort? that's how I evaluate the question of whether community patience is exhausted. I don't think ME is a flat out troll. His contributions are light so not a LOT of effort is justified but I'm not convinced he is not rescuable. Contrast with Tobias, next thread. CLEARLY not a troll, has a big contribution record, therefore worth a fair bit of effort, but I'm starting to think... not rescuable. Make sense? ++Lar: t/c 

Would we simply be gratifying him by letting the RfA run? Blnguyen | BLabberiNg 

    Hard to say. I'm not too sussed either way but I did want to throw out that on balance, gratified or not, this is one time that SNOW isn't the right thing to do. In my view anyway. ++Lar: t/c 

        I think closing it was the right thing to do to avoid disruption. Blocking him... I don't know whether he's a good faith user or not, and I suspect probably not, but I'm generally upset by the level of blocking going on in Wikipedia at the moment. The Land 

    * I think the Masssiveego's RFA voting is a problem and unhelpful, but I think imposing blocks for it is a rather drastic measure. A much better """"penalty"""" would be for the RFA closing bureaucrats to systematically disregard his votes. Regarding the RFA, I agree with Lar that I would not have blocked him for that either, and that a hundred """"oppose""""s on what is in effect an editor peer review might convey the message far more clearly than a block ever will.

Obviously his RFA self-nom wasn't meant to be a serious attempt, but I also don't see where it caused any significant disruption justifying a block. CBD

At present it only appears on the talk page of the one, main article. Would it be proper and useful for me to add it to the talk pages of other articles in the topic area?

Well, thanks for whatever you did - did you also rewrite the caption so it wasn't so long? If so, thanks for that, too. The duplicate is my fault for not doing it right the first time, and I am unable to delete it. The problem now is that file link goes to the duplicate without the copyright - I don't know why since I uploaded the file onto Commons after I discovered the issue with copyright documentation, so I thought the link would go to the correct version. Now I've gotten a message on Commons that the copyright license isn't right though it's plainly in sight http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Supernova_2008D.jpg. - I'm told that I posted only a template, not a license.

 Go to the image description page and edit it to add {{Replaceable fair use disputed}}, without deleting the original Replaceable fair use template.

Alternatively, you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject, requesting that the copyright holder release this (or a similar) image under a free license, or by taking a picture of it yourself.

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified how these images fully satisfy our fair use criteria.

Hi Btphelps - The most important thing in any article on a historical person, whether it is for Wikipedia or an old-fashioned encyclopedia, is accuracy. That accuracy goes beyond just the facts and dates that are presented, and goes on to include any photographic images that are purported to be the individual in question. Recently someone who signs off as OSMOND PHILLIPS has been adding a large group of what are clearly phony photos represented as Wild West historical figures to articles on Wyatt Earp, John Clum, Bat Masterson, Mysterious Dave Mather, Luke Short and Billy the Kid - among others. This OSMOND PHILLIPS cites Robert G. McCubbin, the noted Wild West photo authority and collector, as being someone similar to how this OSMOND PHILLIPS would like to be viewed. What makes this interesting is that my longtime friend Bob McCubbin would be the very first to tell you that the entire collection submitted by OSMOND PHILLIPS, to various Wikipedia articles, are NOT the people they are represented as - without exception. Bob McCubbin allowed me to use a photo of Ben Thompson for a book of mine that was published back in 1982. Bob McCubbin also provided additional photos for my 2015 biography (co-authored with Chuck Parsons) The Notorious Luke Short: Sporting Man of the Wild West.
OSMOND PHILIPS would like to portray me as someone who is not qualified to judge a phony photo alleged to be a figure from the Wild West. Well, those who are familiar with my non-fiction books and articles  know that I have had a 
concurrent career as an artist - a portrait artist. These portraits are noted for their photographic realism. Examples of my portraits were given in my series """"Gunfighters of the Real West,"""" a series of 50 articles that appeared in Real West between January 1978 and December 1985. Other examples of my portrait work of Wild West figures (always based upon authenticated photos of Wild West figures) can be found in each of my seven books. The fact is that you don't have to be an esteemed photo collected, like Bob McCubbin, or a portrait artist/Wild West historian, like myself to identify these photos from OSMOND PHILLIPS as fakes. Anyone off the street should be able to do it - it each and every case - by being shown an authenticated photo of the Wild West person in question when placed side-by-side with one of the OSMOND PHILLIPS photos. So why does OSMOND PHILLIPS do this? I think that individual has provided the answer by claiming that they have some kind of TV show coming up on """"National Geographic and Discovery."""" You want to talk about a """"conflict of interest."""" This person isn't interested in promoting a accurate information (or photos) for Wikipedia - but is very interested in promoting a TV show, and undoubtedly sales of these fake photos to gullible buyers.

I think time will show which one of us has the best interest of Wikipedia at heart. On one side you have an individual peppering Wikipedia articles on Wild West figures with photos that have no provenance - beyond their unsupported say so. Most photos from that era of the photos that have been submitted bear a photographers imprint, or logo, along with the place that  the photo was taken. The photos submitted by OSMOND PHILLIPS most likely have these logos with the photographers address - but don't expect to see them any time soon. On, my side you have a historian and artist who has authored books that have Forewords by noted Wild West historians such as Joseph G. Rosa, Leon Metz and Rick Miller. I have also co-authored a book with Robert K. DeArment (considered by many to be the greatest of all living Wild West historians) and, more recently, Chuck Parsons also a noted Wild West historian and author. I stand on my credentials. This happens to be my 40th year being involved in Wild West history. During that time my reputation for honest and accuracy has been a constant. On those occasions when I've found some errors in my earlier work, I have made every attempt to correct it. I stand on my record - and I use my real name ... which is probably something OSMOND PHILLIPS can't claim.

On a final note I am very disappointed it what just happened to my updates that were being written for the existing article on Billy the Kid. I spent a lot of time on this, trying to provide a lot of missing information that other historians and students of the subject would have benefited from. Well, someone decided to revert to a previous version which not only obliterated just about all of my work, but restored the phony photos by OSMOND PHILLIPS. I challenge anyone, particularly those with an interest in Billy the Kid, to take a look at my version (which was still a work in progress, that I was planning on getting to conform to the Wikipedia format and style) and compare it to what you have now. The person who reverted this claimed that my version was """"unreadable."""" I ask anyone, without an agenda,",0,0,0,0,0,0

 More discussion on ANI 

Ryan has posted on ANI as follows.  Since I cannot reply there, I reply here.  

Ryan: Peter has been blocked previously on a different account for a harassment campaign against FT2 off wiki. 

Comment: This was hardly a 'campaign'.  Consisted of one off-wiki post on a blog that was deleted the next day.  Arbcom has the full details, these have been agreed.

Ryan: Now he resurrected a new account to evade the block and ended up getting blocked again by Thatcher - after discussion, Thatcher decided to unblock. 

After discussion with Arbcom.  The details of the discussion were private, and have never been disclosed by me or Arbcom or anyone else.

Ryan: Now, Peter has continued this off-wiki harassment campaign, turning to soapboxing his ideas about FT2 on WR. 

The basis of the original 'ideas' have now been admitted as true by certain members of the Arbitration committee.  The new 'ideas' are simply that in effect, FT2 is enabling the paedophile lobby.

Ryan: Today he decided to bring the harassment back on-wiki, claiming FT2 made a CU block to """"support the efforts of paedophiles"""" - the gravity of the harassment is large, coupled with the fact that he has a previous account blocked for exactly the same thing. 

As I have said a number of times above, I said that the effect of this action by FT2 is to enable the pro-paedophile lobby.  Please attend carefully to the grammar of the statement. The effect is that already the Pederasty has been reverted, hideous mistakes and all, such as quotations from Aristotle that never existed.     """,0,0,0,0,0,0

The fact that one of PEAR’s own staff was an experimental subject who had a significant effect on their results coupled with the fact that PEAR’s results are not reproducible seems to have created some suspicion.

While I’m not proposing that we add PEAR to one of Wikipedia’s lists of hoaxes, I don’t think that it would be appropriate to use any language that might give the reader the wrong impression.

 are you a troll? 

You call me a troll.
Let's review the facts:
All ancient sources (I AM a historian) mention about 30,000 Dacian warriers in the first war (the so called """"Scond Battle of Tapae""""😉, which was not at all a battle of Tapae, but the battle for Sarmizegetusa, a few miles only further, never conquered by the romans, which fled scared shitless to Adamclisi, 700km further east, where the battle for the Dacian capital Sarmizegetusa also ended! With a shrine inscripted with more than 3,000 fallen roman soldiers, only the limited wall surface of the shrine limiting the names inscriptions.., this also being called by you """"a decissive roman victory""""😉 for Sarmizegetusa, not conqered at that time by the romans, which started towards it but were stopped at Tapae, and when the Dacians stopped fighting because of the legendary """"strange storm"""", """"anger of the Dacian Gods"""", and they were defenceless, the romans, also a few miles only from Sarmizgetusa and open for taking, ran as crazy 700km in 4 days, to their reserve troops at Adamclisi.. and you call this """"decisive roman victory""""😉), and 15,000 Dacian soldiers in the second big war, of AD 105, ending in 106AD.
This correct troops amount stayed a few decades (anyway many years; I made screenshots at some point for a school documentary), and only recently somebody vandalised the site changing the amount in a couple of hundred thousands, with NO SOURCE REFERENCES what so ever, and he couldn't do it too as all historical info points out the tiny Dacian army at that time.
YOU, as administrator, in sted of correcting the vandalism and restore the page, didn't give a damn..
When I came and restored the info, doing YOUR JOB, you acuse me of """"vandalism""""😉, and that """"I am partial to the Dacians"""", while you are the one partial to the romans and to vandalism.
Further more, you acuse me that """"being partial to the Dacians""""😉, I said that the Dacians won, not the romans, adding that """"I did not attach sources ref./proof""""😉.

On the page of the First Battle of Tapae, was allways mentioned (with source ref. attached; poorly and only 1 source while there are many.. but OK) that the governer (of the invading roman army in the DACIAN Moesia) was killed together with his army (that is correct). 
This first battle of Tapae (again BS; it was the battle of the romams for Sarmizegetusa, also stopped at Tapae, Sarmizwgetusa was NOT conquered, that's why was called The battle of """"Tapae"""" which was nothing, just an emlty field, and the roman empire does NOT fight to conquer grass and empty fields) was also lost by the roman army which was totally defeated/anhilated, and even Fuscus died in battle. All these info are correct and o  your/that page. Accepted by you as administrator.
You call this """"a roman victory""""😉.
If i call it as it is,  a Dacian victory, you call me a troll and tell me that """"that didn't happened"""", meaning Dacian victory.
Than WHAT do you call it? 
It's a retorical question.
I am a pretty known international history investigator, and my coleagues often make fun of the wikipedia trolls which poses as administrators. I mean.. the facts speak for themselfs. You change Dacian victories in """"indecisive battle"""", and indecisive battles in """"roman victory"""", which makes you automaticaly bias, and history falsifier, obviously in favour of the invading hoodlam romans. 
You go so far in presenting the invading (into Dacian teritories) romans as """"the good guys"""" and the Dacians as """"bad guys"""", that you even post totally ridiculous texts like """"the Dacians invaded Dacia, and the romans (coming beligerantly all the way from Italy) were right to punishe the Dacians for that""""😉.
How criminal are you?
About you history knowlwdge (if any) is pointless to ask. Right?
All the so called (also BS because the Dacians never started nor wanted war) """"Dacian Wars"""", which were actually Roman wars, started by the invading roman army, and all took place OUTSIDE Italy, into Dacian/Thracian teritories. Roman wars, and you call them """"Dacian wars"""", to manipulate the readers on subliminal levels.

Moesia, which was also Dacian teritory (by the way, you can find this info also on wikipedia if you have no official sources), invaded, masacred and robbed by the roman army coming from Italy, when saved from the romans by the Dacians (as it was part of Dacia), is called by you on your page """"murdering dacians""""😉, """"the dacians swarmed into Moesia to rob and pilleage""""😉.. and other bullshit.
So the dacians were the robbers or the romans??
And WHAT did the Dacians had to rob from their own dacian teritory?? Didn't they have more GOLD than they knew what to do with it, gold stolen by the ROBBER Trajan in AD 106 from Dacia in such huge quantities that the roman empire florished as never before?

POBLACHT NA H EIREANN
___________________________
THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT
OF THE 
IRISH REPUBLIC 
TO THE PEOPLE OF IRELAND 

IRISHMEN AND IRISHWOMEN: In the name of God and of the dead generations from which she receives her old tradition of nationhood, Ireland, through us, summons her children to her flag and strikes for her freedom.

Having organised and trained her manhood through her secret revolutionary organisation, the Irish Republican Brotherhood, and through her open military organisations, the Irish Volunteers and the Irish Citizen Army, having patiently perfected her discipline, having resolutely waited for the right moment to reveal itself, she now seizes that moment, and, supported by her exiled children in America and by gallant allies in Europe, but relying in the first on her own strength, she strikes in full confidence of victory.

We declare the right of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland, and to the unfettered control of Irish destinies, to be sovereign and indefeasible. The long usurpation of that right by a foreign people and government has not extinguished the right, nor can it ever be extinguished except by the destruction of the Irish people. In every generation the Irish people have asserted their right to national freedom and sovereignty; six times during the last three hundred years they have asserted it to arms. Standing on that fundamental right and again asserting it in arms in the face of the world, we hereby proclaim the Irish Republic as a Sovereign Independent State, and we pledge our lives and the lives of our comrades-in-arms to the cause of its freedom, of its welfare, and of its exaltation among the nations.

The Irish Republic is entitled to, and hereby claims, the allegiance of every Irishman and Irishwoman. The Republic guarantees religious and civil liberty, equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens, and declares its resolve to pursue the happiness and prosperity of the whole nation and all of its parts, cherishing all of the children of the nation equally and oblivious of the differences carefully fostered by an alien government, which have divided a minority from the majority in the past.

Until our arms have brought the opportune moment for the establishment of a permanent National, representative of the whole people of Ireland and elected by the suffrages of all her men and women, the Provisional Government, hereby constituted, will administer the civil and military affairs of the Republic in trust for the people.

We place the cause of the Irish Republic under the protection of the Most High God. Whose blessing we invoke upon our arms, and we pray that no one who serves that cause will dishonour it by cowardice, in humanity, or rapine. In this supreme hour the Irish nation must, by its valour and discipline and by the readiness of its children to sacrifice themselves for the common good, prove itself worthy of the august destiny to which it is called.

Signed on Behalf of the Provisional Government.

After all the times you have thwarted me... After all the times my plans for world domination were foiled by your meddlesome interference... After all the countless times you escaped at the very last moment, finally, I, Butros The Mighty, have defeated you, Crum375, Space Commander From Swalwell! 
How long I have awaited this glorious triumph! The Emperor Of The Universe has secured his dominion on this day! And now that my long struggle is over, how about a little... amusement?
With a clap of my jewel-bedecked hands, I summon the scantily clad dancing girls of my Pan-Galactic Slave-Harem. 
I have destroyed your accursed vessel, Star Of Abuse III, and melted it into slag, from which the galaxy's greatest artisans have forged a grand, towering statue... of me! A statue even larger and grander than the one you toppled, pinning me under its plinth, the day you nearly destroyed my Throne Room! The statue stands here in the Grand Ballroom of my Great Celestial Palace, covered in a gigantic space-tarp, but not so fast, Crum, we are not yet ready for the grand unveiling. 
I have captured the traitorous Princess Angela and her rebel allies from the Spaceship Tax Evader and immobilized them in geo-stationary orbit above my palace. At the merest touch of a button, I can activate the Astro-Detonator and delight the assembled billions here with a fireworks display the likes of which the great Butronian Empire has never seen! Princess Angela may be my own daughter, but that will not stop me from turning her and her fellow Wiki-lovers into space-dust. Even now, helplessly strapped into titanium space-manacles, they witness all I say and do on the Projecto-Screen of the Gallant. Hello, my fair daughter. How does it feel to lay eyes once again on your own... DOOM?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
See how I have seized your puny Earth friends, your boob-lover helper Guy Chapman and boy sidekick Jayjg? They too shall be forced to look on as I gorge in ecstasy at your failure and destroy your planet! Even now, I can see they long for me to discharge the Fang-Creatures of Carnivoron into their glass-walled prison, thus releasing them from the agony of witnessing my victory... But no! First, they will watch you writhe in defeat!
And that is not all, Crum! Surely, even slung in your titanium chains above the Flames Of Hate, you can see that to my right I have, held at Blasto-Ray-point by my Robo-Legionnaires, bound and displayed for all to see... Jimbo Wales and his Rocket Squad! Repturova, the Talurnian walking-lizard spy who betrayed me by joining you! Weissus, commander of the Valkyrie War-Jet Platoon! And last but not least... your beloved Julian Van August!
And now, with the merest wave of my Hypno-Scepter... Watch as your darling Earth friend tumbles under my spell. DANCE! Dance for my amusement! Let the sight of your seductively writhing body, contorting itself for my viewing pleasure, be the last thing Crum sees before she is lowered into the Flames! 
Tears?! Do I see tears in the eyes of the brave Crum375, also kown as Linda Mack? Oh-ho! Even I, in my most sinister, depraved dreams, would never have imagined it!
DANCE FOR MY AMUSEMENT! NEH-HEH heh-heh-heh-heh! HA HAHAHAHA!
How glorious! At last, with trumpet fanfare from my Astro-Orchestra, I order the curtain raised from my statue and...WHAT?!! ... It's a newly rebuilt Star Of Abuse IV! And who is that emerging from the gangplank? Crum, herelf?! 
NO! 
Buddy Jayjg has activated a hidden radio signal! The Rocket Squad is bursting free and shrinking my Robo-Legionnaires into nothing with Transmut-O-Bracelets concealed in their manacles! Weissus swings his mighty Space-Mace, smashing the controls to my torturous devices! My Hypno-Scepter, forced from my grasp by Prince Kazak's Magneto-Shooto-Beam! Julian Van August, running free into the awaiting arms of... CRUM?
Then, who is the prisoner suspended above the Flames Of Hate? What? Emitting the telltale sparks and ear-smoke of an android double? Drat! It's nothing more than a simple robo-mannequin decoy! 
Aiyeee! The Spaceship Gallant, with Princess Angela at the helm, is dive-bombing the Great Celestial Palace! Billowing clouds of space-smoke! Crowds running everywhere! Kaff! I'm choking! Kaff, kaff! Victory has—kaff—slipped through my fingers—kaff, kaff!—once again! Kaff, kaff!—CURSE YOU, CRUM kaff 375! Kaff! CURSE kaff YOU kaff FOREVER! Kaff, kaff, kaff, kaff...

Liberal Bias claim
A common quote in this site (how do you call that reoccurring quote? Leitmotiv?) is that """"reality has a liberal bias"""", from Colbert, and it tries to make a point that even though their pages are in fact snarky and sassy their pages are the reality of the subject and have no progressivist or liberal agenda or bias despite so-called conservatives saying so it is in fact biased if it doesn't fit their ideology (that's called denialism). Also, the site points out frequently on the fact of """"quality over quantity"""" of a side of the argument, and that not all sides of an argument have equal weight. For example, in the environmental situation of acceptance the only two viable arguments are that data overwhelmingly supports climate change and the contra is that correlation doesn't equal casuation, but the arguments that science is anti-environmental and that the environment is against God are poor arguments for and against, respectively.
I am trying to say we should include that and to eliminate the """"progressivist view"""" classification of this site. This comes from both experience and newspaper sources. Thank you.

 Vandalism by 99.44.204.232. Please stop it  

Would 99.44.204.232 stop vandalising this article.  People have invested a lot of time and effort to improve this article  it doesn't help if you keep vandalising it.  In future if you have something positive to add to this article please discuss it in the talk page.  I have to spend hours undoing what you have just done.  Citing several sources (some of which are unreliable) about one particular issue which has already been addressed and sourced with notable sources is one thing, deleting edits with notable sources and then copying and pasting those sources to make a point is another.  You wanted the article to talk about Serer Nile Valley migration.  That had already been discussed several times with notable sources like Gravrand, Cheikh Anta Diop, etc.  You also wanted the ethnonym of Serer to reflect the thesis of Diop.  The article already did that with notable sources including Diop himself.  If only you took the time to read the whole article you would have realised that, all these had been addressed. However, you should also appreciate that not every scholar and certainly not the ultra traditionalist Serer who wants nothing to do with Egypt agree with Diop and in fact his thesis were rebutted by several scholars including Schuh, etc.  These are relevant view points which should also be taken into account in other to avoid bias.  

I will now respond to the """"sources"""" that you have provided.

Link 1: 
http://books.google.com/books?id=EZLF3T-5tlgC&pg;=PA706&lpg;=PA706&dq;=serer+wolof+north+east+africa&source;=bl&ots;=6ZlcoUiSsf&sig;=zOFR1CQY5BWf2thxHjWIhmq9Q8Y&hl;=en&ei;=BMFiToPpH6HL0QGE142OCg&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&ct;=result&resnum;=6&ved;=0CEUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q;&f;=false

Have you realised that this source is not credible contrary to all the sources cited? Have you also realised that the author referred to the Kingdoms of Sine and Saloum as Wolof states?  Even the least verse on Senegambian history can easily find out for themselves that the Kingdom of Sine and Kingdom of Saloum were Serer Kingdoms not Wolof never mind a supposed scholar.   
Further, all the sources, historical and archaeological evidence shows that the Senegambian stone circles were built by the Serer people. (See: Gravrand, Pangool; Gamble, Salmon and Njie; Burke and Else; and F. Richard).

Since they were built by the Serers, and evidence have shown that they are built well before the 14th century, how then could the Serers have migrated into the area into the 14th century?  That doesn’t make sense.  Now the Serers may have migrated to from the Nile Valley as implied by Henri Gravrand in “La Civilisation Sereer, Pangool”, which is one of the sources cited in the article,  but as noted by Gravrand, if they did came from the Nile it was more than 5 thousand years ago and certainly not the 14th century. Further, as demonstrated by Gamble, Salmon and Njie, the Serer are the oldest inhabitants of Senegambia, others later moved in.  This backs up archealogical source, backs up Gravrand, Kleine, Richard  and so on.  
If your source was referring to the Guelwars of Kaabu coming from Kaabu to Sine in the 14th century at least I could understand that because it was at that time the Battle of Turubang (1335) occurred as stated by Sarr, Becker and others.  Even the Wolofs were already present long before the 14th century never mind the Serer people who have been present for thousand of years. Further as substantiated in the article with credible sources which all backs up each other, the Almoravid wars on Takrur due to religion (Islam) led to the Serers of Takrur who were finally defeated in Battle to leave Takrur and headed south.  That was in the 11th century during Abu-Bakr Ibn-Umar and War Jabi.  Even those “Takrurien” Serers came south long before the 14th century to join their other Serer relatives (See Daggs).

Hi Michael

I haven't saved your email address, can not find it through Google so must contact you this way. 

I've just paid a random visit at 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_tracking

and found an external link there - 

http://www.goandtrack.com/ ,

the penultimate at this moment. When going through their pages, I also found this one:

http://www.goandtrack.com/gps_tracking_devices/covert_vehicle_tracking.htm .

The first chapter, called 'Covert Vehicle Tracking GPS System', starts this way:

'The latest in GPS covert tracking and communications technology, this covert vehicle surveillance unit is an extremely small size and versatile location device that allows you to track vehicles or other high value mobile assets in real time. The covert vehicle tracking devices is attached underneath a vehicle using the high power light weight magnets. Here it picks up reflected GPS signals and reports position information back to your PC using SMS messages.'

Doesn't that sound promising, so to speak? Unless I'm mistaken, it proves the correctness of my earlier assumptions. I invite you to read the rest of the page and then update the Wikipedia entry. You will remember, for linguistic reasons I prefer not to do these things myself.

I haven't established a webform contact facility, so invite you to contact me directly, if you wish.

RE Thryduulf
My closing statement was not aimed at any user in particular, which you can tell by the fact that I did not refer to any users in particular. You did not specify user names, but you did specify users by their arguments: """"unhelpful meta discussion about the use of T: prefixes in general"""", but when an editor writes , incorrectly, you do not use that argument. This way my arguments were rejected explicitly in one stroke, while wrong arguments are still weighing in. The same can be said for the overstated """"consensus"""": not thrown out (more on this later). You also have used the comment that it is , which is a malversion of my arguments (you did not find). From all this I feel & read that only my arguments were targeted off-topic.

... not whether T: redirects in general should be deleted. This is bs. I reasoned like: """"a T: redirect is bad in mainspace, so these twelve should all be deleted"""". Plain sound reasoning. I did use argumental examples in some places, but I did not, nowhere, argue that other, non-listed Rs are to be deleted. It was someone else who expanded it into too wide  not me. Keep'er """"Technical 13"""", I admid this is a third Keep'er, invokes an """"WP:NS#Aliases"""". But this time it must be deemed not too general (I can not follow, but I must conclude that). If """"Keep"""" individual pages were reasoned to be kept, why not conclude the the others are to go? Requirement for individual mentioning only works one way?
Also, in one point you complain that there was """"no discussion about the individual redirects"""". Well, that could also be because an argument applies to the whole list (a logic you disallowed explicitly). Then, when I do point to individually addressed Rs (here above, linked), you do not see a contradiction in that. Even worse, when I do demonstrate there are Rs named specifically, you respond here with but not everybody agreed with you. This does not undo my point that individual templates were addressed. Confusingly, here you are jumping the reasoning.
As was repeatedly pointed out the most recent times that it was discussed the consensus was that at least some were useful and that there was no consensus for a prohibition on their creation or use. Here it is you introducing arguments from *outside* the RfD list at hand. Earlier RfD's outcomes as an argument? How am I allowed to argue with that? WhenI use an argument involving general sanity (not even stepping outside this RfD), it ends up in the bin. And, above I linked tot two more recent R deletion conclusions (a G6 """"non-controversial"""" speedy! March 2013, and a full RfD-list deletion in December 2010), that contradict your reasoning. Also you write T: as a prefix or the use of such prefixes in general in the closing and XfD not RfD here. That is an expansion of the topic beyond RfD. Why is that allowed?
It doesn't matter how long ago a consensus was reached - it applies until there is a newer consensus formed, it doesn't somehow expire.and Consensus can change, and older consensuses are often more likely to, but ....  No  was reached. Repeat: there is no consensus. You are repeating an editors' 2007 injection -not a conclusion- into an essay. With that, indeed it is irrelevant how long ago the irrelevance was written: today it is still irrelevant. II note that you took over this bogus claim from an editor. As for old or new 'consensus': can an admin research & report how many T:-redirect were deleted without RfD, over the years? Of course, they leave almost no trace for non-admins. But I'd like to see the numbers & arguments for all T:-redirect deletions since template space was introduced. Some 'consensus' must be visible in there too. There is no consensus. So there is no argument from that  non-existent consensus. And don't blame me for introducing """"history"""" as a reason. 

Yes, you argued about specific redirects, but not everybody agreed with you. Out of logic. Why do you say this? You concluded that there was no individual targeting (and check that the nom is addressing them by listing them, and that the nom is detailing arguments very specific). The I point to them, and you jump to arguments. Did you or did you not see them when closing?

 In particular your proving that transclusion didn't work was argued to be not relevant to way the redirect was used (remember these are redirects to templates not templates), and and your opinion alone does not demonstrate consensus. A catch 22 you created. First you complain that no individual Rs were mentioned, then I point to one that was already there, and then you say: but that is not consensus.

It's basically part of how Muslims have been instructed to address the Prophet whenever he's mentioned (peace be upon him), so I thought it'd be helpful to teach Islam with an Islamic understanding.  Perhaps, I should have hyperlinked my addition to the article above?  Please reconsider.

If you want to be taken seriously, then act like other parties. You are so focused on Immigration that you do not make it clear what your other policies are. You may think “What am I talking about, I know nothing, I do not listen to the news and your broadcasts, I am an idiot.” This is what politicians always say when they are challenged. They fight to humiliate the other person.

I do try to listen to your policies but they are masked by your racism. Ask anyone on the street and whether they're a supporter or not, they know that you want to get rid of non-indigenous peoples, and probably nothing else about the party except Nick Griffin's history. What I am saying is that you are stopping yourselves from being elected. You are your biggest enemy.

I am not saying that I disagree entirely with your immigration policies, as I do not consider myself a socialist, but immigration is all I know of you. Make yourself more likeable and you can become an easy to relate to right wing party, no Nazi nonsense.

I would like to begin by apologising if I have upset and annoyed people. That has never been my intention, my only intention is to contribute towards Wikipedia and improve articles involving subjects which I am particularly interested in. However, just because I have been blocked for my actions, that will not stop me from standing up for what I believe is completely right and trying to forge a consensus on facts which I believe certain editors are deliberately ignoring.
I will start with Kathy Beale and why she should be included. Those of you who have been watching EastEnders for a very long time will recall, that Kathy had a major involvement in the Ian's custody case. I will use a few sources:

- These links is Kathy's direct involvement in trying to rescue the Beale kids from Cindy Beale.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CvgCs5c_Vw
- This link shows that Kathy was involved in the storylines regarding Lucy and Mel Owen, often having to look after the kids when Ian was very depressed - a very important storyline.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kyf5XoJl58

- These show Kathy's strong involvement with all her grandchildren - Lucy, Peter and Steven. She even had to go to court for them. All of that is aside from the babysitting, family meals, Christmases and her death which had an effect. I will make my edit, and I hope afer watching all these clips, people will come to realise what I mean and what we can come to an agreement. I'd go as far as to argue that Kathy is more involved to Lucy's storylines, than Bev Williams - in fact that is a fact. So let us all take stock.",0,0,0,0,0,0

8b90cd974a33caca,"Coat of Arms of Vermont 
Hi, I presume your request is related to my assessment of the article for the heraldry and vexillology wikiproject. My reasoning was basically that it was too long to be a stub, and didn't have GA status, which meant it had to be either Start or B class; since it was on the short side I went for Start. Having read it once again I can't immediately think of any content which could be added. This is a problem I have with all coat of arms articles; once you've said what it looks like, when it was first used, who designed it and any possible symbolism, there's really not much else you can say unless the arms are old enough that you can trace the historical development. Having said that, it would possibly be interesting to know why the state has both a seal and a coat of arms.

I would however take issue with your statement Vermont is the only U.S. state to have authentic armorial bearings described in a blazon. First, what do you mean by an authentic coat of arms? Are there states which use fake coats of arms? Also given that the arms are an example of landscape heraldry you might find people arguing whether they are actually 'authentic' arms. Secondly, a blazon is just a written description of a coat of arms; given a picture of a coat of arms someone sufficiently experienced in heraldry can produce a blazon, so there's nothing particularly unique about a coat of arms having a blazon. (In the European tradition it is in fact the blazon that defines the arms rather than the visual representation). Thirdly, if you want to get picky, blazon usually refers to the anglo-french jargon used to describe coats of arms, whereas the blazon of the CoA of Vermont is more like a layman's description, although it does throw in a few heraldic terms (I note that the external link you provide refers to the blazon as 'quasi-heraldic terminology'). Finally Vermont is not the only state which has a blazon enshrined in statute, see Coat of arms of North Dakota for example.

Regarding possible improvements, I would be inclined to add subheadings, e.g. history, blazon,Vermonter's badge. Also, now that you've added a couple of other sources it would probably be good to add citations to indicate which facts come from which source. The external link says that the arms were not defined by statute until 1862, but the article says differently; is the external site wrong? Quoting the statute numbers could possibly be useful. A couple more images could also be good, e.g. of the arms being used today, or historical versions showing the 'considerable liberties taken'.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Most professional economists are on the payroll of the FED, so of course they reject Austrian economics. AE is, however, the oldest continual school of economic thought. Moreover, it doesn't have the dismal track record of mainstream economics, which, to quote Bill Maher, is a litany of getting shit dead wrong. From the Wall Street crash 1929, to the non-existent depression of 1946, to the Bretton Woods system, the stagflation of the 1970s, the S&L; crisis of the 1980s, the dot.com bubble of the 1990s and the housing bubble of the 2000s. From Keynes' suggestion to bury FED-notes in glass jars underground and let people dig them up, to Samuelson's insistence on the USSR overtaking the US from the early 1970s to 1989, to Krugman's Space Alien Invasion solution to our present day crisis.
Just to name a few examples of the top of my head. With a track record like that, of course they will shun the one school of thought that get things right, that understand what economics actually is and, more importantly, what it isn't.
It's not the mainstream economists that don't take AE seriously, it's the other way around. For good reason. So excuse me for not being all giggly about your supposed training in economics. Like Jefferson said, you'd be better informed of current events if you didn't read any newspaper at all than if you read those of his day. Likewise, you're likely to have a far better understanding of economics if you've never taken an economics course than having spent years studying Keynesianism, monetarism, neoclassicism or whatever mishmash of mainstream schools that gets taught in the universities today.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Hi, Doug Weller. I don't have the actual book, but see the references in another book, but I don't know hwy you say I got his name and book name wrong. How exactly?  Also, you missed the point about it being from the 1960's, as that actually BOLSTERS UP my point and what I said repeatedly """"long-held"""" and """"long-established"""" explanation.  (And it's in the very name of the section that I put on here, if you notice...""""long established"""").   So, frankly, given that, I'm exactly not sure why you're complaining about the """"half a century ago"""" matter, instead of seeing the arguable pro and point for that, in what I was saying all along. It's a long-known thing that ancient cultures sometimes hid things and embellished others.   Also, again, how and where exactly did I get his name wrong?  His name is J.A. Wilson, and he did write a book (according to what I have) called """"World History of the Jewish People"""" in 1964.    So where's the error exactly?    Please let me know.  Thanks.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

If you have not created this media yourself then there needs to be an argument why we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then it needs to be specified where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.

If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the  tag can be used to release it under the GFDL. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, consider reading fair use, and then use a tag such as  or one of the other tags listed at Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use.

 The LGBT Portal has once again been revamped and a work rota started. Efforts towards Featured Portal status are slowly coming together.
 The assessment system has been a great success, we have tagged over 4000 articles! Please tag any LGBT related articles you come across by adding {{LGBTProject | class=}} to the talkpage. Please see the Assessment Department for how to assess an article according to the grading system.
 The Translation department has changed its focus, to LGBT articles about non-English topics and people on which there may be more information on the relevant foreign Wikipedia. Please add your name if you are fluent in any language other than English.
 Jumpaclass is picking up slowly, with nine people having entered. With over 2000 stubs we need to improve our article quality. Please sign up and get it going! Challenge another user to see how far you can jump a stub!
 There is an ongoing discussion about the current LGBT categorisation system here, here, and  a little bit here. A special page has now been set up here to deal with this.
 A Watchlist has been set up to monitor controversial and/or highly vandalised articles. It can also be used for article disputes, just add a note explaining the nature of the dispute.
 With the influx of so many active members, there is now enough support for a LGBT studies peer review, which may be found here. It's in the beta phase at the moment, so bear with us if we make any mistakes. Feel free to peer review any articles you have been working on.
  It was agreed this month to start reducing the uses of the Notice board, as many members felt that it was not effective. An open tasks template has been created, bringing together important announcements, FAC/FARs, Peer reviews, XfDs, the COTM, and requested articles. You may desire to [ watchlist] it. A Deletion sorting subpage is also now working to bring together XfDs - this should be bot-driven, but we have not currently tagged enough articles to make this fully automated, so please update the list with any LGBT-related XfDs you come across.

_ _ If you've a longer-term interest in adding names to LoPbN's list, it would probably also be worth clicking on an edit of the """"Pol"""" section, to see how i reformated it.  (I make a point of providing a lk to the edit screen, rather than the page, since you would miss a lot if you looked at the article page but not the edit screen.)  The 2nd comment is there to preserve for other editors (who may be interested in creating such an article) the information you provided, since in its original form it impedes rather than furthering the navigational purpose of the LoPbN tree: the detail offers no help in locating the specific E. Poole that a user has in mind, and it would be far more valuable in her future bio article itself.

 Semi-protected edit request on 24 November 2014 

The article currently states:
There is no scientific evidence for the effectiveness of Ayurvedic medicine for the treatment of any disease.

There are a few issues with this statement that make it unsuitable:
 An absolute negative is, of course, impossible to prove, and quite a high hurdle to even support reasonably well.
 There are countless examples, including some mentioned in both the cited article and this Wikipedia article, of ways that Ayurvedic treatments have been effective at treating an assortment of diseases.  The cited article includes 5 examples.  (Many statements about the efficacy of Ayurveda concentrate on major disorders.  But, eczema, as one minor example, is a disease which is readily treated by Ayurveda.  So, it may be appropriate to state that there is a lack of evidence showing its efficacy for treating """"certain diseases"""", there is no way to support the claim that there is no scientific evidence as to its effectiveness in treating """"any disease"""".)
 If there were strong evidence supporting the likelihood that """"no scientific evidence"""" existed, then it may be a suitable statement.  But, such an strong statement requires strong support.  The only supporting evidence is one article which is not an academically rigorous source, and which, itself, offers 5 examples of scientific evidence supporting that certain Ayurvedic medicine is effective at treating certain disorders.
 The statement that """"there is no scientific evidence [...]"""" is a claim, and not a supported fact.  For this claim to stand, it should be better supported.  Or, it might better be reworded.

I propose that the above claim be replaced by:
Though some studies suggest the efficacy of some Ayurvedic treatment for certain conditions, the science is inclusive as to the efficacy of Ayurveda as a complete system of treatment.

This statement is supportable and non-controversial.

I may come up with a list of disorders with supporting evidence as to Ayurvedic efficacy to broaden the claim that Ayurvedic treatments have been shown to be effective at treating certain conditions.  However, in the interim, I think there is sufficient cause to remove the claim that there is absolutely none unless such a statement could be at least strongly supported.

I also think it is mere rubbish but I also think it is not completely rubbish. According to the southeast asian history, most of the ancient rulers of this region are Hindus, some rulers came from Persia (map covered Middle east, Greece, west India - Achaemenid Empire, Seleucid Empire, Parthian Empire and Sassanid Dynasty, please look at the size of the map their conquered). Kedah is a good example where the king from Persia came and eventually he built a kingdom.

In the old days, it was slavery society (no sultanate and no democracy yet), all Hindu rulers belong to higher class, common peoples and the natives belong to inferior slave class. The Hindus rulers came from India and Persia and they ruled most of the southeast asia, they called themselves high class peoples, the rest are merely slaves. Parameswara is a Hindu ruler, he is one of the descendants of the Hindu royal family that belong to higher class of Hinduism.

As for the Macedonian bloodline, this is also not completely rubbish. In the old days, the Persian empire was so big, they are so proud with king Alexander the Great. Also, they ruled some of the southeast asian lands such as the Angkor, Pasai, etc. Parameswara later married Pasai's princess and adopted Persian Shah and claimed as descendant of Alexander the Great, I don't think all this is completely rubbish.

First of all, I have a right to request an honest higher up moderator (in other words one who is known for not having an agenda) because I have been abused by the very people you say I should submit to.  Why would I do that?  There are a lot of people on here who have agendas in their use of censoring and blocking. that is a fact and just because there are many of them does not mean that they are correct to do this. By the way, my """"ridiculous"""" post recently (BTW,  I have been banned for doing less then using a word as provocative as ridiculous) is not at all.  You in fact missed the point of the two or so sentence comment. I was saying why do all of the photos with him posing with a fellow politician exclusively include Republicans. that is a very reasonable thing to point out.

Every second year the Falcon is going to be replaced. It's a difficult situation because Ford Motor Company Australia is the last Australian designed and manufactured company that isn't working on the base chassis and running gear that FoMoCo USA is putting out. Truth be told, the Ford Falcon is the ONLY remaining Australian car (which I didn't see mentioned in the article, I'll address this in a sub thread).

However, OP is correct. The EA and EA 30th anniversary model and mk ii were possibly one of the most reliable of Ford Falcon's releases, the fuckers used to push up to 600,000 on the odo before engine parts started to fail. Many taxi used variants rolled the clock over, I remember seeing a mates hit the big 0's on all original parts, and owned a 30th as my first car.

That being said, the Taurus would never compete, it's too expensive and too shit. FoMoCo AU left the EF in the microwave a bit too long and it resulted in AU's. Some of those were washed with cold water and shrunk into what they termed the Taurus. 211.30.150.155  00:49, 9 December 2011",0,0,0,0,0,0

The difficulty is that someone has picked these matches out as having particular significance.  And in so doing they are voicing an opinion that they are significant, without any cite that says """"this was one of Sharapova's must notable matches"""".  And that's even before we consider the match analysis that goes along with it.

To give an extreme example to illustrate; what would you say if I was to create a section called """"Maria's Greatest Moment"""" and write about my favourite Sharapova match winning forehand smash (with a cite to a mention of the match).  All factual, but with an emphasis that is entirely my POV.  And even if we all agreed that, yes indeed, this was her greatest moment, it still would be entirely POV unsupported by reputable sources.  This """"Notable matches"""" is obviously not as blatant, but it's the same thing.

 needs you...]]
Our first collaboration article for 2009 is Cockatoo—a well-known Australasian family of parrots.  The article is already in reasonable shape, thanks to early efforts by a number of contributors, and with a little more work, we should be able to get it to GA/FA status.  Can we get our first """"group star"""" for the year on this one?
On a related note, be sure to vote for April's collaboration article, which will be chosen on March 31.  If none of the existing nominations interest you, consider adding a new one!
Please be sure to mark any featured lists as FL-class rather than FA-class.   All of our current featured lists have been moved into this new(ish) category.
Beginning in April, we'll be removing from our """"active participants"""" list the name of any editor who hasn't edited on Wikipedia for 6 months or more, putting them instead into a """"retired editors"""" section.  (Please note that will be easy to move yourself back into the active category if you start editing again after an extended absence.)  This should help us to better evaluate our project's editor retention and make for more efficient newsletter delivery. Videos
We all know the old adage """"A picture is worth a thousand words.""""  And if that's true, videos are probably worth 10,000!  They're a great way to add information to articles—for instance by showing behaviours that are hard to explain with text or static pictures.  They can also include audio, adding a dimension unavailable in a photo. If you don't have your own video camera, you can still help the project by finding and requesting videos from others who have already taken them (checking, for example, at Flickr, YouTube or The Internet Bird Collection).  If you have questions about how to upload videos, several project members, including  or , may be able to help. Newsletter challenge
 took up the last newsletter's challenge, and started our article about distraction displays—behaviors used by birds to lure or drive potential predators away from nests or young.  This month, we're looking for someone to start an article about acoustical luring, which is a method used by some predatory birds to lure potential prey into reach.  The person who creates this article and gets it beyond a mere stub level will be mentioned in the next newsletter.Got a suggestion?  A correction?

 Reviews and meta-analyses...get your secondary sources, folks! 

There are 398 papers that fall under the """"Reviews"""" tab at PubMed on the query """"Homeopathy"""" (out of 3545 total papers). Below are a selection of interesting papers (that my institution can access) from the last couple of years, with money-quotes from abstract conclusions. I stopped after a couple dozen, travelling back to ~2002; this list isn't close to exhaustive, but it may prove useful for discussion & article building. Any responses should probably be made in a new section, or a subsection of this one, just for navigational clarity.

There is currently little evidence for the efficacy of homeopathy for the treatment of ADHD.

...some homeopathically prepared remedies show promise for reducing infarct size and associated impairments...Individualized homeopathy may even play a helpful adjunctive role in treatment of sepsis. However, a great deal of systematic research effort lies ahead before most of the options discussed would meet mainstream medical standards for introduction into routine treatment regimens.

...experiments with a high methodological standard could demonstrate an effect of high potencies. No positive result was stable enough to be reproduced by all investigators. A general adoption of succussed controls, randomization and blinding would strengthen the evidence of future experiments.

The evidence from rigorous clinical trials of any type of therapeutic or preventive intervention testing homeopathy for childhood and adolescence ailments is not convincing enough for recommendations in any condition.

The [studies] were generally of low methodological quality...Homeopathic medicines, tested in HPTs, appear safe. The central question of whether homeopathic medicines in high dilutions can provoke effects in healthy volunteers has not yet been definitively answered, because of methodological weaknesses of the reports...

The results suggest that, for several treatments, the risk-benefit profile is encouraging...For other therapies the evidence is weak or contradictory: homeopathy...

Complex Homoeopathy...showed inconclusive results.

effectiveness of homeopathy can be supported by clinical evidence and professional and adequate application be regarded as safe.

Kent wrongly describes the Sathya Sai Baba movement in Malaysia as a """"Hindu Revitalization movement.""""

Yes, my view is that Lord Burghley did not take financial advantage of Oxford and other royal wards.  In fact, a book of Lawrence Stone's (as I recall) demonstrates that Lord Burghley put the Earl of Rutland, a royal ward, on his feet again financially through his management of Rutland's affairs during Rutland's wardship (Lord Burghley was a good friend of Rutland's stepmother).  The wardship system was a cash cow for the Tudor monarchy, and although Lord Burghley doubtless profited from his position as Master, he did not take financial advantage of his royal wards.  In particular, since this article is about Oxford, Lord Burghley did not take financial advantage of Oxford during his wardship.

 Price of oil 

Bogorm, you really need to discuss your changes on the talk page.  You are making some fundamental editing errors which would need to be cleaned up sooner or later, and the fact that you keep reverting to your version is getting disruptive.  Also, please try to find sources other than Presstv.ir, as they have a conflict of interest in this subject and thus may not be the most trustworthy of sources.  If other sources are saying the same thing it is much more persuasive to the readers of this article.    
 I am not interested in American stance towards the PressTV and I urge you not to remove the source. If your obstinacy towards removing """"numerous"""" and """"augmented"""" is inexorable, I should """"die Flinte ins Korn werfen"""", as the Germans say, and laissez-faire... . But I assure you I am habitually not so amenable as in this matter. Besides, it's the above mentioned POV towards PressTV that I find disruptive. But methinks Wikipedia is more than copying from sources and if the Iranian which wrote the artcle, preferred to express himself about augmenting in Simple English, that does not interdict us from rendering his words in a more elaborate manner, does it??? And this is not the Wikipedia in Simple English, is it? Ah, one more thing - as most speculators are not Iranians, methinks it's beyond the """"La Manche"""" that most conflicts of interest are engendered...   

Have you at any time used any other user name
Your style of editing is not that of someone who has just started editing Wikipedia. Have you at any time used any other user name?   
 No, I have not. But I acquired experience while editing in the Bulgarian Wikipedia and Bogorm is since approximately one month the global name for all other language-editions of Wikipedia, where I am active, it is not only the bg Wikipedia.   

Then I suggest that you read Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Macedonia#Final decision (Balkans warring).   
 Why am I referred to it? Have I edited any article on the English Wikipedia related to Macedonia? Because in the immediate past I am not able to recollect such edit of mine...   

Because it refers to Balkans article in general see Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Macedonia#Area of conflict.   

Three-revert rule
As you are new to the English Wikipeida and are actively repeatedly editing Radovan Karadzic related pages you also need to read Wikipedia:Three-revert rule so that you are familiar with its restrictions and do not breach them.

This is why of the dozens of regular MMA contributors were part of this at the start, but now there are none. Think about that for a second. We can sit here all day and talk about consensus, but the way it's been going on in this case is fundamentally wrong.

I think the one mistake in the argument above is the assumption this was just like any other wiki consensus with reasonable parties, but it's very unfortunately not.

With regard to Durie I think we've reached consensus to keep it out.

With regard to Breivik - it's a reliable high quality source, it directly supports the text that is being included, it is obviously notable (the fact that breivik used the term and how he used it), and it is relevant. So I really don't see any reason for removal except some kind of WP:IDON'TLIKEIT

With regard to the side bar - the underlying problem is that the very subject of this article, """"Dhimmitude"""" is a POV-loaded term itself, usually used by people with a particular ideology. Part of that ideology/POV is the view that Muslims always and everywhere discriminate against non-Muslims and that this discrimination is captured by this term. But once again - this is just a POV of a particular ideology. If this sidebar was text we could properly attribute it (so and so says that Dhimmitude reflects discrimination etc.) But with a sidebar we cannot do this. Since we cannot properly attribute a sidebar the only recourse is simply to remove it. This is the same as if someone tried to put an """"Apartheid"""" side bar in the article on Israel or something - it'd be POV, just like it is here. In fact, given the generally fringe usage of the term, by fringe folks, an """"Islamophobia"""" sidebark would make a ton more sense than the """"Discrimination side bar"""".

8c539c9a8fb16564,"""

As a Wikipedia, I am aware of the three main guidelines for editing articles about living people and feel I have not strayed from them in my editing of the article about Paul Offit. 

On Neutral Point of View:

 I was merely stating the conflict of interest of the """"studies"""" done by the committee affiliated with the AAP claiming that the Rotateq vaccine was safe when the very academy this committee is a part of takes bribes from the very corporation that manufactures the vaccine, Merck. Clearly, these people who receive hundred-thousand dollar contributions from vaccine makers are completely unreliable on topics such as vaccine safety. Studies allegedly confirming the safety of a product should never be considered reliant if done by those who would profit off them.Besides, 89 patients have been given the vaccine and died. This along with the conflict of interest done by those who claimed the vaccine was """"safe"""" shows that there is no reliable evidence that rotateq is safe. 

Verifiability: 

I provided valid links, 1 to Medalerts describing the adverse effects where Rotateq was administered and the patient died. 88 of such cases can be found on the website. The second to CBS news in which Sharyl Atkisson reveals hundred thousand-dollar contributions taken by the AAP from pharmaceutical corporations such as Merck and Wyeth.For deaths associated with Rotateq: 

http://www.medalerts.org/vaersdb/findfield.php?LOWAGE=&HIGHAGE;=&VAX;=ROTHB5&SEX;=&VAXCNT;=&STATE;=&VAXMAN;=&VAX;_DATE_LOW=&VAX;_DATE_HIGH=&VAXLOT;=&ONSET;_DATE_LOW=&ONSET;_DATE_HIGH=&VAXDOSE;=&SUB;_DATE_LOW=&SUB;_DATE_HIGH=&VAXROUTE;=&REPORT;_DATE_LOW=&REPORT;_DATE_HIGH=&VAXSITE;=&L;_THREAT=&PRIOR;_VAX=&ER;_VISIT=&CUR;_ILL=&HOSPITAL;=&HISTORY;=&X;_STAY=&SYMPTOMS;=&RECOVD;=&LAB;_DATA=&DISABLE;=&OTHER;_MEDS=&DIED;=Yes&V;_ADMINBY=&DEATH;_DATE_LOW=&DEATH;_DATE_HIGH=&V;_FUNDBY=&PAGENO;=1&action;=Find&PERPAGE;=10&SORTING;=NONE For conflict of interest within AAP: 

http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/07/25/cbsnews_investigates/main4296175.shtml 

Original Research:

 This is not original research as nothing added made any definitive claims beyond what was stated in the sources. The fact that infant patients who were administered the vaccine, including a set of twins died after receiving it and that the evidence provided attempting to show the vaccine is safe was essentially done by an organization tied in with the vaccine manufacturer shows that there is no reliable proof that the vaccine is safe. 

Despite my keeping within the Wikipedia guidelines, I was repeatedly blocked by User:MastCell, my citations deleted. Some were on the excuse of """"libelous,"""" but they were all factually verifiable, and had cited sources. So then I wrote in these same facts again and along with how User:MastCell is acting as a minion of Paul Offit by censoring all negative information about him however true and violating Wikipedia's guidelines as a responsible administrator. Angered, he has blocked me indefinitely for """"personal attacks,"""" when I merely wrote them in response to his own abuse of power by censoring anything negative albeit factual about Paul Offit as """"libelous."""" Ironically, MastCell violates all of the above. His verifiability for stating Rotateq is safe comes from a Merck-funded Association, his neutrality is limited to the point of censoring any negative information about Paul Offit that is verifiable, correct and unobjective, his original research comes from drawing the erroneous conclusion that Rotateq is safe on the basis of """"studies"""" essentially funded and determined by the drug's own manufacturers. Therefore, I appeal to nullify my week-long blocking. I would also suggest blocking User:MastCell as he has actually violated Wikipedia Terms of Use himself, especially since he holds the responsibility as an administrator, the basis on which he has used to block me.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Whatever Bondeson's credentials, i think the central claim of this article (that upon """"Hitler's orders"""" superdog members of the SS were being sought), founded solely on a book by Bondeson that none of us has read, is probably false.

 Objectivity of Circumcision article should be flagged due to Gilgal Fellows on salary who patrol & edit the article 

As a matter of curiosity

As a matter of curiosity, if a person with a Circumcision Fetish found his way to this article, would they be allowed to edit it as an authentic observer? By the way, the circumcision in front of the grass hut on page 5 of the WHO pamphlet, """"Global Trends,"""" would indicate that the purported HIV protection targets village people who live in primitive conditions. Would that also target the English-speaking readers of a wiki site like Wikipedia? ... Anyone ever hear of an educational foundation known as the Gilgal Fellows  perhaps an entry in this article could describe their work. Joe Circus (talk) 

    Unfortunately it appears anyone may edit the article regardless of a conflict of interest. I have also questioned the relevance and impact of third world African HIV studies on our modern audience to no avail. Garycompugeek (talk) 

        Thanks for the link to a conflict of interest. Since there are a number of fellows who edit this article, it would be helpful to know if any of them have information about the Gilgal Fellows described here It could be revelatory for Circumcision Wikipedia to include a section on the Gilgal Fellows, who apparently have quite a mission. It's my understanding that GILGAL is an obscure word for MOUNTAIN OF BURNING FORESKINS. Joe Circus (talk) 

            No one having objected to the proposed sections on Circumcision Fetish and the Gilgal Fellows, I will assume a consensus, delegate the research, and get back here with it ASAP. Joe Circus (talk) 

                It's impossible to assess such a vague proposal. If you provide some specific, sourced content, we can assess its suitability. Jakew (talk) 

                    """"...we can assess..."""" Now would that be the Royal We or you claim to speak for other fellows? Joe Circus (talk) 

                        """"We"""" refers to myself and others who may be interested in evaluating the proposal. Jakew (talk) 

                            All the same, I don't get why YOU in particular deigned to represent the other fellows without asking their permission. It'll take a lot of Human resources to put these sections together... and if the """"consensus"""" is already fixed in advance, what's the point? Joe Circus (talk) 

                                Perhaps it's a little presumptuous, but it's realistic. It's usually a safe bet that more than one person will comment on a proposed change; take a look at the archives if you want to confirm that for yourself.
                                As for your proposals, previous discussions have found that there are no reliable sources discussing a """"circumcision fetish""""; searching Google Scholar for """"Gilgal Society"""" indicates that there are no reliable, secondary sources regarding that subject either. So I would think it doubtful that content could be written in a way that conforms to our policies. Jakew (talk) 

                                    """"Our"""" policies?... You mean the Gilgal Fellows? I'm not certain WHO you're representing here. Joe Circus (talk) 

                                        Wikipedia's policies, obviously. Jakew (talk) 

                                            Another reader deleted this interesting discussion for some reason. In trying to improve the Circumcision article, it's important that we discern between authentic readers and those who are paid a salary to patrol and manage this article. That's not a personal attack, nor a lack of presumption of good will. It's merely being realistic about who finds their way to this controversial article, and a healthy cynicism about some readers' intransigence. One reader has left a very rude & domineering comment on my user page. If personal attacks like that are the norm, I can only assume that a number of fellows are paid to patrol this article, and its objectivity should be flagged on the title page.

I like that you started with a clear definition of a Preparator and Art Handler and next described the responsibilities of the role.

I would just like to suggest that similar to the roles of Registrar and Collections Manager, in some institutions there may be differences between the roles of Preparator and Art Handler. For example, the last Preparator who worked for me was also responsible for helping prep and customize the storage areas, photographing objects (as part of cataloging) and exhibition installations, and ensuring frames and hanging hardware were in good condition, which may not be typical art handling functions in some types of institutions. As you described I often engaged outside art handlers when I had to move a lot of art quickly, such as when the museum’s board of directors decided to paint the entire museum and gave me only a week to prepare.

Another great reference for professional Preparators and Art Handlers is the Preparation, Art Handling, Collections Care Information Network (PACCIN )

I can be banned because it is argued that I have been harrasing people by asking """"who do you work for"""", which in the case of a cover up of information is a perfectly valid question to ask, and was indeed answered by the person in question of their own free choice.

 Query 

I suppose I should have taken the point better when you made it here. This is neither a challenge, a complaint, nor a whine, or an attempt to """"gotcha"""" but a ood–faith question and a related comment on which I'd like your observations.
Question: John Bapst Memorial High School 2005 was nominated — not by me — and subsequently deleted yesterday under A7. (I think that's the one, not being a sysop — ahem () — I can't go back to look to make sure.) The entire text of the article was something like, """"Composed of people born in 1986 and 1987. Said to be the best class to ever graduate from this school."""" As I understand from the discussions at Talk:CSD, an indication of importance or significance is credible if it is plausible, even if it is vague and unsupported. That school's class of 2005 could, in fact, have been the best to graduate from that school in many different ways: highest GPA, most athletic championships, fewest teenage pregnancies, or in a 5–year retrospect, most graduates to be admitted to Ivy League schools. None of that is, of course, probably what the creator meant, which was probably nothing more than chauvinistic chest–thumping (but we must AGF). Was that an indication of importance or significance such that the article should not have been A7 nominated or deleted on that basis?
Comment: If I were to start declining A7 speedy noms by strictly applying the criteria you set out at my RfA nomination, viz """"A7 simply does not apply if there is any credible indication of importance or significance"""", then I have the suspicion that at my next RfA nomination, if I choose to try again (and your responses here may help me decide whether or not I will do so), that I may have a hoard of opposers claiming that I'm perverting the CSD process by glibly dismissing valid CSD nominations. I'm concerned that by working on CSD nominations at all that I'm stuck between the battle lines drawn by the deletionists and the inclusionists. If I have any remaining desire for the mop, wouldn't it be better to just avoid CSD altogether?

8c95ef06a4e49f96,"""My behavior, certainly as a newcomer to Wikipedia has never been destructive, nor am I a vandal. I am a veteran journalist, writer, and editor with many years of experience. Though I've made mistakes as a Wikipedia newcomer, I am not oblivious to the attempts by some to make a mountain out of a molehill in this short a time I've been a member of Wikipedia. As an example, I was recently blocked without knowledge of this being done, and with no proof as to the reason but citing """"edit warring"""" which I did not partake in. Moreover, the more I cite sources that are verifiable, and the more I read, and apply Jimbo Wales Wikipedia principles & guidelines, the more trouble newcomers seem to get into with what appears to be a clique of POVers, and """"revert warriors"""" who take the honest mistakes of newcomers, and turn them into immediate accusations, use of pronfanity, and the """"one-way"""" pastes of comments from me onto RFC & arbitration pages - taken out of context, without adding their OWN comments on edit summaries, and talk pages. I find this curious - since, to prove that a person is doing such a thing as they say - revert warring - and being """"disruptive"""" in honest writign & editing, and citing sources, and references, that some such as Ruud, Bunchofgrapes, and others, would find it useful not to add their own comments which, if arbitration members can find them - contain a hostile tone, reject attempts to work together, are mean, avoid sourcing themselves, with their own entries very much POV while """"revert warring"""" without first reading, or seeing the sources cited. This has happened many times with me in just over one month and I just got here. Some on the RFC page who signed have even resorted to deleting their comments to fit their accusatory assertions on Theodore7 - but pasting my comments as one-liners - and sentences as """"proof"""" of my being disruptive? If this is the case, then why do they not add their own comments, and my return comments in context? Doing this - cutting, and pasting my words OUT of context to then fit into their accusations - is what is going on, and this only makes more suspect their own Wikipedia edits; which, are very weakly sourced (if at all) despite my doing so, and asking others to do so in accordance with Wikipedia principles, and the advice of some Wikipedia administrators who were kind enough to help me without biting a newcomer - nor making immediate accusations designed to disrupt themselves. For instance, Bunchofgrapes made several """"reverts"""" on materials I added sources to - and then turned to make rude comments on edit summaries. I asked him to please not do this. It seems more common to not cite sources and to """"revert war"""" - a term I did not know existed before joining Wikipedia. It seems that many of the crew who complain so much about the newbie Theodore7 have been """"revert warring"""" for some time. I just stumbled onto some rather neferious POVing, and """"reverters"""" who throw out that claim onto others if they do not agree with something that is counter to their own point of view. This is why citing verifiable sources is important. However, some just seem to think Jimbo Wales' principles do not apply to them. I think different. I am new here, and I read, and am applying more of Wales' principles and guidelines as I go along - despite some who would laugh at this, and, if one is good enough to read through all the """"complaints"""" about Theodore7 - other would mock Wales' principles & guidelines, and tell newcomers not to """"use"""" him as a excuse, etc. This is the kind of thing that has been going on since I recently joined Wikipedia.

""""Vaguely""""?!  Really?!  I've explained this in great detail, ... but whatever.  Let me see if I can clearly explain how these subjects interrelate:
Various figures of differing fame have proposed teleological arguments for the existence of God (technically any god, but for all practical matters, this mostly concerns the Christian God).  These arguments from design are described in the Teleological argument article.  They are rarely referred to as simply """"intelligent design,"""" and thus, have little to no claim to that term for its common name.
A specific teleological argument is presented as science and an alternative to evolution.  This purportedly scientific theory is called Intelligent design (ID) and it is described here, in the Intelligent design article.  It is not necessarily associated with the Discovery Institute, and therefore claiming that this is the """"DI version"""" is inaccurate.  There are no strict """"versions"""" of the teleological argument anyway; there are different arguments from design made by different people, and they are identified by the philosopher/theologian who proposed them.
From my perspective, the articles are well-organized, though not above improvements.  If the name of the article on the """"scientific theory"""" is a problem, we ought to have a discussion about the names of these articles, instead of trying to manipulate the lead of this one and obscure its topic.  If """"Intelligent design"""" is deemed to be the common name of the subject currently described in Teleological argument, there needs to be a discussion with the folks there to change the name.  This article can then be renamed to something else (in the past, I've suggested adding creationism to the title).

I have been wondering about Polycheles typhlops. I would have nominated it myself for DYK, if only I had been able to find a good hook. It really is a fascinating animal, but there's nothing (cited) in the text that jumped out as instantly notable. I agree that the """"two species"""" claim is false, and that the reference proves it (planktonic larvae can be easier to find than animals living on the sea floor at depths of >2000 m, so it's not that surprising that species have been missed). I wasn't sure if someone else would find a good way of re-wording it and save the DYK entry; I certainly couldn't think of one, but I didn't vote it down just in case. That DOI is an odd thing indeed. Springer Link definitely gives the same DOI I put in the article, but dx.doi.org doesn't recognise it. It's not even as if it's a very new article that hasn't made it into the DOI database yet. I have added a link directly to the journal article; I am wary of removing the DOI, because it *ought* to be right, although I doubt that it will come back to life. At least this way, people will find the article if they need to. Oh, and thanks for rescuing the conservation status of the Steppe Field Mouse.

Why a recluse?
I came to this article to discover why exactly Harper Lee became a recluse. It does not really say for sure. I would be interested in knowing that if anyone happens to know.

She didn't exactly become a recluse. She just doesn't give interviews or write novels. She does have friends and family and she travels frequently.

Oxford

Does anyone know what college Ms. Lee went to at Oxford and what she studied while there?

I believe she was studying law when she went to Oxford for a one-year exchange program from the University of Alabama. I can't find a reference to which college she joined. If this was before the colleges became coeducational, that might narrow the candidates down to a few. I think Lady Margaret, St. Hugh's, St. Hilda's and Somerville were women's colleges.

Claims of descent from Robert E. Lee

Our article claimed that Harper Lee was a descendant of the Confederate General. A reader sent an e-mail to the Robert E. Lee Memorial Association to confirm this. They advised: I regret that Harper Lee is not a descendant of General Robert E. Lee.  There is a chart of Gen. Lee's descendants on the Stratford web site www.stratfordhall.org.  Click on """"history"""" in the left navigation bar, then click on Robert E. Lee, scroll to the bottom of his page and see the link to his family tree.  General Robert E. Lee has very few descendants, considering that he had seven children.  None of his daughters married and only two of his sons had children.  I hope that this information is helpful.

It appears, Ron, that you are frustratingly reading my paragraph above as if that is what I want to put in the article, when what I want to put in the article is posted on my talk page in one place so that it can be seen without continually being pushed up by discussion. My comment above is only *explanation*.

Sigh. Here again is what I want to put in the article. It's on my talk page. Sigh:

""""1. Not to be confused with shoto meaning """"short sword""""; confusion about the derivation of """"Shotokan"""" may occur otherwise. The Kanji for shoto, """"pine waves"""", is (松涛). The first character is (松), which means pine tree. The second character (涛) is a kanji variant of (濤), which means large wave. The Kanji for shoto, short sword, is (小刀). The first character is (小), meaning small, and the second character is (刀), meaning blade. Any literate Japanese reader who saw """"松涛"""" would not mistake it.""""

You say that you do not *agree* with this, but you cannot seem to explain what is *wrong* with it. It would make no claim whatsoever, when posted in the article, to any reasonable person, that the """"short sword"""" story is being told out there (even though it is; I just don't have it in a book for you, so I'm not trying to claim it on Wikipedia). It can be looked at as *preemptively* preventing confusion.

For someone who says he wants to work together, you are laying down a lot of conditions. I think it is reasonable to say at least:

""""1. Not to be confused with shoto meaning """"short sword"""". The Kanji for shoto, """"pine waves"""", is (松涛). The first character is (松), which means pine tree. The second character (涛) is a kanji variant of (濤), which means large wave. The Kanji for shoto, short sword, is (小刀). The first character is (小), meaning small, and the second character is (刀), meaning blade. Any literate Japanese reader who saw """"松涛"""" would not mistake it.""""

I think it's reasonable of me to dispute not showing the Kanji and it's reasonable of me to dispute not having that first sentence that basically says """"Note that this use of shotodoes not mean """"short sword""""."""" If you want to put in that sentence rather than """"Not to be confused with..."""" that would be fine with me.  08:32""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Definition of islamophobia
I think the root cause of problems is the disagreeance between Axon and me about the definition of islamophobia. Axon wants the Runnymede Trust definition of islamophobia to be held as universally valid, while I want the dictionary definition to be used. 
Axon and other users argue that because the Runnymede Trust definition for islamophobia is supported by """"a wide range of international bodies and governments"""", it is universally valid.

Dictionary definition of islamophobia: 
Prejudice against Islam and Muslims.

Runnymede Trust Definition of islamophobia:
Islam is seen as a monolithic bloc, static and unresponsive to change. 
Islam is seen as separate and 'other'. It does not have values in common with other cultures, is not affected by them and does not influence them. 
Islam is seen as inferior to the West. It is seen as barbaric, irrational, primitive and sexist. 
Islam is seen as violent, aggressive, threatening, supportive of terrorism and engaged in a 'clash of civilisations'. 
Islam is seen as a political ideology and is used for political or military advantage. 
Criticisms made of the West by Islam are rejected out of hand. 
Hostility towards Islam is used to justify discriminatory practices towards Muslims and exclusion of Muslims from mainstream society. 
Anti-Muslim hostility is seen as natural or normal. 

I and other users argue that the Runnymede Trust Definition has severe logical and factual fallacies and that the Runnymede Trust is not a neutral and impartial source.

Resolution Must be Made

I have been an observer of this article on Abbas Babei since the start of this conflict. I want to point out that we this issue needs to be solved otherwise both users will face blocks. Hooperag has offered a proposal that makes logical sense, Imagine this was the article of Barack Obama, we can't just say: """"Obama is notorious for his merciless treatment towards the minters of parliament who oppose his policies"""" (that's a totally random example, but whatever). It is more appropriate that if you wish to include a subjective statement like """"Babaei was """"notorious for his merciless treatment of the pilots and officers"""" considered disloyal to the new regime"""", you include some background info on who made that statement (add more context). The word """"merciless"""" is very subjective (opinion based) and if it is to be used you can't use it as if it was fact based, when you say """"Babaei was notorious for his merciless treatment of the pilots and officers"""" you are making a strong statement about him that makes it seem as if it is a 100% true fact that he was merciless.
 For these reasons I suggest we rephrase the sentence to be something along the lines of Hooperag's suggestion whish was to rephrase it something like this: """"According to the famous historian Tom Cooper whom interviewed various Iranian pilots, Abbas Babaei was considered """"merciless"""" in his treatment towards pilots disloyal to the new regime"""".

I wish to make it clear that I do not endorse any party, neither Hooperag nor the IP. However the proposal sounds reasonable and has been the only proposal to resolve this dispute so far.If this issue is not resolved with in the next 24 hours or so and the conflict continues, I will request to an admin that both users be blocked.134.39.77.59

Anyway, you too have fun Sue.

Enjoy.

1. Gene_poole, it is not MY pet project - as stated clearly more than once above. That's one more proof you don't read thoroughly what people write - and similarly, you don't check thoroughly things which you delete. Thus, I'm not convinced you can give any actual evidence there's an explainable reason for deleting it. The quote I provided in the initial letter here is a quote from the creator of this project. He said his opinion about you clearly. Not that he cares about any Wiki trolls, Mr know-it-alls and control freaks. The fact that he doesn't even bother wasting his nerves on this discussion here is eloquent enough. But I do care when I see injustice. Not that my """"little rant"""" would change anything. But am I someone who remains silence? I could at least make my """"various pronouncements"""" when I saw injustice. Wikipedia at least allows this, doesn't it? As for the proofs, links and evidence you requested, I shall commit my efforts to collecting them with the guidance from the original creator of the Alphistia project, and present them to you here. After that, it is up to you, to show whether justice really exists in Wikipedia or it is really subject to control by self-authorised junkies as my impression has always told me.

2. I understand the rules of Wikipedia and its standards for verifiability. But I can name you at least a dozen Wiki entries which don't have verifiable source either, save some crafted websites linked to them (that's not a reliable source, anyone can put up a website about anything) - and they still remain. Moreover, I cannot see how you made the conclusion that Alphistia was """"made up in school in one day"""" by reading """"my webpage"""". And, aren't most other invented utopian micronations created in exactly the same circumstances? Isn't this exactly what it's all about? It's not about existing micronations.

3. """"Wikipedia places a high value on verifiable reliable sources"""" - that's pretty ridiculous, as far as anyone's invented micronation is concerned. Invented projects like this do not exist - that's the main idea of utopia. What a material proof do you require? This project has been around the place for many years, and has been presented in internet space for quite a long time - and in more than one place (it has its own website, its own LiveJournal blog and a network of fans and devotees who have developed a community and have even started learning the invented language of the micronation in question) - but all this remained out of your sight as you were deleting it at random, without even checking anything about it. My only conclusion: it made you jealous, and abusing the powers that Wikipedia gives you, you did not hesitate for a minute to do what you've always done (yes, I've been following your epics over here for some time).

4. """"Do you have press coverage, books, real-world items proving it's been an active, well known project?"""" - if you had made the smallest of researches, you'd have found out that this project has participated on a number of exhibitions (the latest one, in Germany) and has picked up some awards among other such invented micronation projects. As for real-world items, the only ones for now are postal stamps issued in recent years - that's something I doubt most of the projects on this list can pride of.

In conclusion, I think this discussion remains pointless until the moment when I provide the above """"proofs and evidence"""" requested. Then, I'll be looking forward to your response.

As for the statement about Wikipedia pronounced in the above Letter, I believe things will change some day here too, though this looks rather unlikely at present. One day, guys like you will be stripped off their undeserved powers. Because the idea behind Wikipedia is too utopian itself - complete freedom brings anarchy. But I admire its democratic principle - everyone has equal rights to express their opinions without being deleted or edited by someone else to whom they don't sound suitable. As for the Truth, the Facts (what is """"notable"""" enough), the Truth is only what the more powerful present it to be.

 General Authority Assignments 
Thanks for updating Elder Zivic's assignment. However, I looked on LDS.org and failed to find any mention there of his assignment. I see two other seventies (though I can't remember who) that are listed as Assistant Executive Directors of the Temple Department, but under Zivic's LDS.org biography, that assignment is not listed. Is it possible that this was a previous assignment that he has now been released from? As soon as LDS.org has an updated list of assignments, I guess we'll know for sure. Please respond on my talk page, as I don't habitually check other users' talk page for a response. Thanks.   
Hi!  I do recall that LDS.org's bio on Elder Zivic does not list the Temple Department assignment.  Actually, as I recall, it does not list anything subsequent to his previous service in an area presidency.  I obtained the information from other directories I reviewed.  There are actually 4 assistants at the present time to William Walker, in his role as Executive Director.  Hope that helps some.  Thanks for the question to ensure we're on track.   
On the list we have, I see Elder Choi, Elder Zivic, and Elder Gibbons listed as Assistant Executive Directors of the Temple Department. So now my question is, who is the 4th person you spoke of? Also, on the list that you are taking this information from, does it contain any other assignments of general authorities that we can put on that page? Again, please respond on my talk page. Thanks.   
It is Elder Baxter and I have updated that portion of the table/info box.  Thanks!   
It seems you forgot to respond to the second question of my last post, so I'll ask it again: On the list that you got the information from about the Temple Department Assistant Executive Directors, does it list any other assignments for seventies that we don't have on the WP list? Any additional information you can contribute would be appreciated. Again, please respond on my talk page. Thanks.   
I didn't forget, but I don't believe there is anything else that we would add, so I probably just skipped over the inquiry. ) There are some items that need to be officially announced before they are included as well.  Thanks!    
There are other changes, but we'll have to wait until they're officially announced? I really wish you hadn't said that. My curiosity is piqued. I won't ask what these changes are, much as I want to. You're probably not at liberty to say. One question I can ask: Where are you getting all this information? Do you by any chance have access to the CDOL? What Church position do you hold that allows you to be privy to this information? These are questions I feel I can ask. In the meantime, for the sake of my sanity, any additional information you feel you can give me, even if we have to wait until it's officially announced to list it here, would be appreciated. If you can tell me anything, I promise that I won't make it public. However, if you can't give me any more details until it's official, I understand completely. I am copying my comments here to my talk page, where I hope you will respond to this post as you have the past ones.   
 Ha ha - OK, sorry to have piqued the interest!  Nothing major, but always need to ensure the proper order is followed when updating info.  Yep, there are a few good opportunities to see updates in what goes on across the church.  Yes, I know, not a great answer! )

 Understanding how Wikipedia does things 

Hello Mike, I see you have some concerns about the article. First off, I want to note that this is exactly why we always tell people don't try to write your own article on Wikipedia. I was willing to write one for you because I think you're an interesting subject, but you really need to stop trying to work on your own article. It is absolutely impossible for you to be objective about your own work, and also you keep trying to make edits which are not properly sourced. To answer a few points:

Why are the links to the National Traditional Country Music Association pages and the Library of Congress Recorded Sound Reference Center underlined in red as non-existent? These sites do exist.  They are non-existed on Wikipedia; we aren't saying they're non-existent in general, just that nobody has written an article about them here yet. The red means """"someone should write an article about them"""". Before they were blue because you were re-routing the link to go to their own homepage, but we don't allow such external links to be used in the middle of the page like that, and also because that obscures the fact that we need somebody to write those articles.
 Regarding your nickname: if you say Plantenga is wrong, I've removed the nickname. However, you cannot simply go and fill in whatever nickname you want in its place, unless you have a clearly cited source.
 You really need to read our guideline/warning WP:Autobiography to understand exactly why you shouldn't be messing with your biography. You should not be making any edits on that page except to remove blatant vandalism. Again, you are literally the last person on earth who should be editing your own biography on Wikipedia, because doing so compromises the neutrality of the project.
 Lastly, I really suggest you read WP:Verifiability, not truth. The long/short is that a given fact is only useful if it can be cited to a good source, and no matter how true a fact is, it's no good on an encyclopedia without citation. So while we of course recognize that in the larger world, accuracy is the goal, on an encyclopedia our concern is how documentable a fact is. So on a certain level, we literally don't care whether a fact in Plantenga's book or in a Washington Post article is completely accurate, we care that it's clearly documented. Whereas if you make """"corrections"""" based on your personal knowledge, that just makes the article weaker because each such edit decreases its Verifiability.

At this point, you really need to just accept that you have a biography on Wikipedia, and it's sourced to published works, and be (moderately) happy with that. Wikipedia is absolutely not here for you to """"get the rest of the story out"""", or """"build your brand"""" or whatnot, we're just here to compile and organize information that has already been published by neutral experts. So please refrain from trying to edit your own article, it always ends badly and wastes time for everyone involved to have to change things back and forth, and just trust the Wikipedia community to do our best to keep things running smoothly.

As WP:CONSENSUS says, 

In determining consensus, consider the quality of the arguments, the history of how they came about, the objections of those who disagree, and existing policies and guidelines. The quality of an argument is more important than whether it represents a minority or a majority view. The arguments """"I just don't like it"""" and """"I just like it"""" usually carry no weight whatsoever.

 Frat Pack 
The Frat Pack is a 1990s-2000s era nickname given to a group of male Hollywood comedy actors who have appeared together in many of the highest grossing movies since the late 1990s, including Ben Stiller, Jack Black, Will Ferrell, Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson, Luke Wilson, and Steve Carell. It was coined by USA Today in a story from June 2004.USATODAY.com - Wilson and Vaughn: Leaders of the 'Frat Pack' Before USA Today dubbed this group the Frat Pack, Entertainment Weekly referred to them as the """"Slacker Pack,"""" but this term is rarely used.  Meanwhile, EW had earlier used the term Frat Pack to describe Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Edward Norton, and Ryan Phillippe, but this usage has not been seen elsewhere. Since then, EW has dropped the """"Slacker Pack"""" term, and also began referring to the group as the Frat Pack .  The name is a take-off of the Rat Pack, a nickname given to a group of entertainers in the 1950s and 1960s combined with the shorthand term for a college fraternity, a reference to the group's popular film, Old School. In December 2007, Italian cinema magazine Nocturno published the first 70 pages dossier completely dedicated to the Frat Pack phenomenon.

 The Pack 

The USA Today article which coined the Frat Pack term listed Jack Black, Will Ferrell, Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, and brothers Owen Wilson and Luke Wilson as members of the group.  By 2006, Steve Carell was also included in the Pack when USA Today published another article.  Carell claimed membership when hosting Saturday Night Live. Though he did not use the term """"Frat Pack,"""" he did say he was """"one of those guys now"""" and specifically referenced Stiller, Vaughn, Ferrell, Owen Wilson, and Black.

A year before citing Carell as a member, USA Today tagged him, in addition to Judd Apatow, Paul Rudd, David Koechner, Mindy Kaling, Nancy Walls and Leslie Mann as the Frat Pack's """"Junior Varsity."""" USATODAY.com - Carell just wants some love Kaling and Walls haven't been as associated with the group elsewhere, but Details Magazine has cited Apatow (in addition to directors McKay and Phillips) as """"The Frat Packagers"""",The Power 50: DETAILS Article on men.style.com while Paul Rudd was cited as a Frat Pack member in the New York Post, among other publications. In an interview with The Advocate, when questioned if Knocked Up will officially welcome him into the Frat Pack, Rudd speculated that he is a """"pledge"""" that hasn't """"been initiated yet into the brotherhood."""" Issue Number 980 | Big gay following: Paul Rudd | Advocate.com  

The members of the Frat Pack often work with certain directors multiple times. Wes Anderson is a college friend of the Wilsons and directed them in both Bottle Rocket and The Royal Tenenbaums (which also starred Stiller) while Todd Phillips directed both Old School and Starsky & Hutch. Adam McKay directed Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, and Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby.  Judd Apatow is the writer/producer of several Frat Pack comedies including Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy. He made his directorial debut with The 40-Year-Old Virgin starring Steve Carell, and followed up with Knocked Up starring Seth Rogen and Paul Rudd, with a cameo by Carell. Apatow was also a cocreator of ''[[The Ben Sti",0,0,0,0,0,0

Wikipedia does not have a user page with this exact title. In general, this page should be created and edited by User:59.180.173.138.

Nonetheless, it is good to see such fictitious people emerging and these new 'entities' are probably one among the scores of sock-puppets being used for manipulation on wikipedia.  

It is of course pointed out that I have not made any personal attacks but pointed out not just glaring contradictions and discrepancies but also but steadfast refusal of such 'contributors' to realize these points and make corrective action.

I have posted in detail above about my contributions on the Chola dynasty and explanations and justifications for such postings along with not just the sources but also the quality of such sources and information.

I am indeed waiting for detailed discussions in case required. Unless that is done, any deletion of my contributions without assigning reasons is also as improper, as per established Wikipedia norms, as posting or making additions to an article without giving sources and references.

I am sure a neutral admin like Taprobanus and other contributors from the Tamil Nadu group will certainly reason in my trying to better the quality of the article on Chola Dynasty.  

Through the medium of this post, I also request the admins to initiate a debate on the origins of the so-called 'Chalukya Chola dynasty' which according to me never existed... (all the inscriptions right from Kulothunga I to the last Chola king Rajendra III) bear evidence to the fact that these kings either directly or indirectly, NEVER addressed themselves as Chola Chalukya or Chalukya Chola.  It is again the handiwork of manipulators who seek to maintain and continue the title Chalukya Chola.  By the same token kings after Vikramaditya VI in the Chalukya page should be called Chola Chalukya because that king was a son in law of Virarajendra Chola.. and Hoysalas after Veera Ballala II starting with his son Veera Narasimha should be called Hoysala Chola or Chola Hoysala because Ballala II was a son in law of Chola king Kulothunga III.

 Greetings from the Opera Project again 

Hi, Satyr.  You'll remember that you and your bot did some excellent work for us (on the Wagner sub-project) a few months ago.  How are you fixed at present?  We'd like to dip a bigger toe in the assessment process by automatically giving a """"Start"""" rating to those articles that are tagged with the Opera Project banner and are not already classified as Stub.

Exceptions:  articles which have been promoted to Good Article, Featured Article or Featured List should show those ratings on the banner.  Also, it would be good if any articles which currently show Stub on the banner but have been manually de-stubbed without the banner having been altered could be rated Start.

We'd like the facility to comment when we start doing the assessments.  For the Wagner project, you organised it so that the banner carries a dormant link:  if a comments page is present, there's a link, but if not, not.  The link will nevertheless appear (and work) if a comments page is subsequently added.

I can give some examples of the various possibilities outlined above if that would help, and you might like to review our correspondence about the Wagner project to refresh your memory of what you did then (also to refresh your memory of how useless we were then at specifying what exactly we wanted, maybe!).

Hope to hear from you when you have a moment.  Best.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Maba Diakhou Bâ 

I first came across the Maba Diakhou Bâ article when I was looking for articles relating to Senegambia.  Having read the view history section of the article, it was evident that it has been on display for quite a few years now.

The purpose of starting this discussion is to disagree with several aspects of the historical account being presented in the Maba Diakhou Bâ article, based on reliable secondary sources as stated in the notablity policy.  Although I have primary documents about the man Maba Diakhou Bâ, I will stick to secondary sources in line with Wiki's policy.  Before I start to put forward my counter argument, I think a brief history is necessary for those who are not well familiar with the subject.  

Maba was a Senegambian jihadist in the 19th century who spent years launching wars against non-Muslim Kingdoms in order to convert them to Islam.  As it will become clearer , you will find out that converting people to Islam was not his only objective for launching jihad.  In any case, he was partly responsible for the mass conversion of the Senegambian people particularly the Wolof people and other tribes in the 19th century.  This is very significant, because Senegambia which encompasses Senegal and The Gambia are predominantly Muslim countries.  The Muslim population are the descendants of those converted in masses in the 19th century many of whom by Maba Diakhou Bâ.  Islam being very strong in both Senegal and The Gambia especially with the advent of the Muslim brotherhoods of Senegal, Maba Diakhou Bâ is given a saint like figure in both Senegal and The Gambia.  As such, no one dares to comment on the atrocities of Maba, his back handed dealings with the French and British administration during the colonial era, his enslavement of people whom he viewed as non-Muslims, his pillaging of lands etc.  Instead, the Muslim majority of Senegambia led by the Muslim brotherhoods of Senegal have fabricated his historical account and pass it off as facts that some historians have fallen for, but of course there are others who will not be duped and have examined the true facts and written it accordingly.  It is very important to point out here that, not all ordinary Senegambian Muslims feel this way.  Many of them try to go about their daily lives with little thought for these kind of things.  There are of course others who take the words of their religious leaders as scripture that is infallible even if ample evidence is presented to them.  In most cases, when I talk about the Senegambian Muslim masses, I am referring to the Senegambian Muslim establishment, who mingle in politics, control what historical or religious programmes are presented in the media etc.  These are the ones who control information and whose desire to is release the type of information they want others to know and believe.   Having said all that, I now address each of the inaccurate accounts presented in Maba's article.  

Maba was killed on the 18th July 1867 at the Battle of Fandane Thiouthiogne commonly known in Senegambian history as
The Battle of Somb. He was killed by the Serer people led by their King Buur Sine Kumba Ndoffene Famak Joof when he thought he could go and launch his jihad against the Serer people as he had done with other non-Muslim tribes and kingdoms.  (Sources: Histoire du Sine-Saloum  by Alioune Sarr, and Essai sur l’histoire du Saloum et du rip by Abdou Bouri Bâ)

The article did not give us the exact date he died and in the """"Death and legacy"""" heading, made a transitional error as to the year he died by putting """"1876"""" instead of """"1867"""". I will also address that section of the article later especially in relation to the first paragraph

In the first paragraph of this article, it says and I quote """"He became leader Almamy in Saloum"""" and under the """"Resistance and Conquest"""" heading,  (in other words resisting French colonialism as noted in the first paragraph of that heading) it states and I quote 
""""While he eventually succeeded in overtaking the dynasty of Saloum, his movement never succeeded in Sine, (Kingdom of Sine) and much of Serer territory remained animist or Christian into the 20th century.""""

First of all, Maba was nothing more than an Almamy in rebellion.  He was not a King with all the powers of a King and him overthrowing the Serer Dynasty of Saloum has not been accurately narrated in this article which I will delve in later.  Note also that in the last paragraph of the first heading, the article talks about how Maba founded Nioro du Rip, but it did not tell us in any part of the article how he founded it, just like in the whole article, important pieces of information has been",0,0,0,0,0,0

After Arkansas Preservation redesigned their web site a few weeks ago, there are a number of issues with the NRHP part of the site.  I have found at least two instances of listings that are missing from search results, and numerous PDFs of listings are also missing.  If you find what seem to be missing entries, you can try to find them the NRIS mirror run by Elkman, which has all listings up to about April 2010 (i.e. it has no listings or delistings after then).  If they show up in Elkman but not on the Arkansas Preservation site, contact them (info@arkansaspreservation.com), they're pretty good about responding.  On the old web site, I would report errors or omissions that would be fixed within a business day.  Sometimes the omission from their site is caused by an imminent delisting.  For bridges, you can also see if Bridgehunter has images or other information (like better lat/lon, which these two listings need).

In this case, listings for """"Cove Creek Bridge"""" and """"Cove Creek Tributary Bridge"""" both show up in Elkman (Tributary=95000644, Creek=95000645), and are given separate resource identifiers (in the """"Other Names"""" field in Elkman: Tributary=LO0051, Creek=LO0050).

This block is even more outrageous and illegitimate than the first. You didn't even allow me to say anything; that alone makes this charade illegitimate and unacceptable. The whole essence of Dougweller's argument over the last few weeks has been that article talk pages can and should be viewed in isolation when addressing a dispute. Bbb23 and JamesBWatson agreed with him in this regard and that was the main basis for punishing me for the recent conflict that was started by Mzilikazi1939. Therefore my actions of yesterday constitute complete compliance with the rules and the comments from these two administrators. As was made crystal clear on Talk:Aesop yesterday, Mzilikazi and his friends never complied with the rules set out in WP:ERA in their latest attempt to change the article Aesop. I already tried merely correcting their illegal actions and explaining it in edit summaries and personal talk pages but they continued ramming through their illegal changes, so yesterday, even though corrections of rule breaches should not require discussion, I made the peace-making effort of explaining the matter on the talk page Talk:Aesop.

I went above and beyond what was required in order to see a peaceful resolution to Mzilikazi's edit war and I fully complied with both the Wikipedia rules and the wishes of the two administrators who had judged on the issue. If I broke the rules by obeying those administrators then the first block was obviously not valid and therefore an indefinite block now is not allowed. In fact, any punishment now would not be allowed because the alleged rule breach was entirely due to the directions given by Bbb23 and JamesBWatson, i.e. that article talk pages, as asserted by Dougweller, are meant to be viewed in isolation from other talk pages. My peace-making efforts yesterday were most certainly not a """"diatribe""""; it was a clearly and thoughtfully written explanation of what the issue was, how Mzilikazi's actions breached the rules and even how to resolve the matter. Unlike what we've seen from Mzilikazi and Dougweller consistently, I included no personal attacks in my efforts of yesterday. Bb23 made the dubious accusation that I had used personal attacks in recent weeks but I reject that entirely; I never called anyone names and I never tried to rely on ad hominem arguments to """"justify"""" my position, unlike what we've seen from Mzilikazi in particular. Yesterday's edit was completely free from personal attacks; that's undisputable.

The very fact that Bbb23 would describe yesterday's tactful, eloquent, peace-making effort as """"diatribe"""", an extremely strong word, is more than enough proof that he has strong feelings about the issue and, as per WP:INVOLVED is therefore ineligible to participate in an administrative capacity here. This is a breach of the same policy that User:EncycloPetey broke when he banned me years ago, causing him to be stripped of his administrator status. I was already wondering how Bbb23 could block me the first time with that non-sensical, contradictory excuse for an explanation.

If article talk pages aren't meant to be viewed in isolation then both Aesop's Fables and Aesop are meant to be using the standard English style of dates. That is what I originally insisted but for that I was blocked by Bbb23. However, if, as asserted by Dougweller and agreed to in the rulings of Bbb23 and JamesBWatson, article talk pages are meant to be viewed in isolation then Aesop's Fables is a lost cause and Mzilikazi has got away with his change there but Aesop is still meant to remain in the BC/AD state. Yesterday's edit is in complete compliance with that ruling and I even made the additional effort of explaining it on the talk page to ensure that I could not be successfully accused of making trouble. For anyone who reads what I wrote at Talk:Aesop yesterday, there can be no doubt that not only did I comply with the rules yesterday, but I even went out of my way to work towards ending Mzilikazi's conflict peacefully and in accordance with the proper procedures.(  )""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Can anyone perhaps elaborate on this? I mean, the dousing of the painting with acid is reported as though this is a normal thing to be done to a masterpiece and so nothing further needs to be said about it.

Ekadashi, in Vedic (Vaishnava) calendar is a fasting day. This is day of Lord Hari (Vishnu), so one has to dedicate this day to Vishnu, thus one has to do more fasting, especially from crops (beans). In Vedas persons refrain from meat, eggs, flesh/blood 'food' completely, but on this day (Ekadashi) one even refrains from beans/crops like rice, as Kali (material lust) may hide there on Ekadashi day. This day Vishnu has to be satisfied and not our tongue, belly etc.

Padmini Visuddha EkAdasii occurs during the light fortnight (shukla paksha) of the extra, leap year month known as Adhika month. This Adhika month is considered to be very auspicious (adhika = best or greatest), as Vishnu appearing Himself. This month (Adhika Maasa) comes once every two (sometimes three) years, and so also this Ekadashi. Padmini Visuddha EkAdasii'' comes on Purushottam Shukla Paksh'''.

The countries were illegally annexed, and there is a considerable difference between de facto and de jure; if I steal your car and then forge the title, it may be """"my car"""" in that I drive it, register it, paint it hot pink and invite my relatives to live in it, but a Wikipedia article on the matter would probably best be entitled """"Theft of Dojarco's car.""""  The article on O.J. Simpson's murder case at Wikipedia is entitled O. J. Simpson murder case. Calculating numbers of countries is tangential to the legal aspect, as explained above  basically, most free countries that had relations renewed relations, never having recognized the legality of the forcible annexation. Many countries did not have relations prior to the occupation, because many were not sovereign back then (e.g., India was part of the British Empire, etc.  a list is available here ). I have nothing against including information on who did and who didn't recognize the annexation within the article, and the article should include information on the """"lameness"""" of continuity, too. But if you would emerge from the innards of this debate a bit  a person interested in the occupation (or even the argument that there was no occupation) would generally expect an article like this, with a title like this. It's a frequent search term. One includes denial in the Holocaust entry, and there are separate entries on Holocaust denial and even Criticism of Holocaust denial  but this does not mean that we agree with Holocaust denial, does it? The occupation of the Baltic States is not universally agreed upon, no  but not too many things are universally agreed upon. Presenting the prevailing view and serious alternate views is what an encyclopedia is supposed to do. You write: Saying Baltics were not annexed is pure nonsence and extremist POV. Nobody here said that the Baltics weren't annexed  what some here are saying is that they were illegally annexed whilst under occupation, and that is indeed the prevailing view.

Hello Brion: I have been politely asked to """"read the archives"""" before editing on a contentious article and realize this is going to take a while and require lots of notes. ) I decided to setup a personal Wikimedia-on-a-stick so I can work locally (much faster, I live in a rural area and have a somewhat slower connection) but the history limit on export is an issue since there are a lot more than 1000 edits. I saw you were able to do this before here and was hoping you would be willing to do it again maybe?

The French flag was not inspired by the flag of the Netherlands. This theory put forward by an anonymous user repeatedly in the last days is simply not supported by any proof and seems to be only a (chauvinistic?) guess from that anonymous user. Actually, ironically, I found out that it seems the Netherlands designed their flag in the 17th century based on the blue-white-red colors of the Bourbon of France. According to the French Wikipedia it is King Henry IV of France who suggested these colors to the newly independent Netherlands. Finally, the Netherlands did not have borders with France at the time of the Revolution as the anonymous user wrote. France had borders with the Austrian Low Countries, but not with the independent Netherlands.
 30 June 2005 11:06 (UTC)

The original colours of the Dutch flag were orange, white and blue. King Henry V of France did not suggest to the Netherlands to use red, white and blue. The Dutch started using red because the orange colour was unstable in flag making.

HurricaneWarning Template

Greeting, My Friend,

Both """"camps"""" in this discussion have compelling arguments, and I'm not sure on which side of the dispute I'd settle if I decided to comment.  You are correct that the template in question is contra ASF, and is not something anyone would wish to see universalized by extrapolation: every WP article could merit some sort of advisory template, if one accounted for every possible precaution.  I concur also with MiraLuka, and find the wording of the template slightly paternalistic.

You have requested consultation, I think, because the arguments advanced by your respected opposites appeared insufficient and/or policy-contravening.  I do believe their arguments have great strength, despite some flaws.  Examine, for a moment, your comment:

""""If the primary purpose of the template is to aid/advise readers in a humanitarian fashion (as I think it is), then the template exists to serve goals that are, IMHO, wholly unencyclopedic and irrelevant to the project (the death of a few readersor even valuable contributorsand the concomitant bad press is likely to have only a de minimis deleterious effect on the project)""""

From the record, I see that you registered with Wikipedia in late-December 2005; as such, you may not be familiar with the facts (and the turmoil) surrounding John Seigenthaler, Sr.  In that instance, a single false assertion (albeit a very significant one) garnered for Wikipedia enormous negative press attention, and caused many observers to question the viability and basic premises of the project  a great boon for the Britannica boosters.  The lessons of that episode are numerous, but those applicable here include: 1) The smallest misplaced line of text is a potential danger; 2) Liability for a project in the public eye exists not simply in the law, but even moreso in the press.

It is a sad commentary on the state of the American public that I can easily imagine many readers relying solely on Wikipedia without thinking for themselves.  In most contexts, caveat lector; let them be undone by their ignorance.  In highly visible situations, however, where the press is likely to overextend itself in finding and pillorying any """"villian,"""" no matter how remote the causation, or how unjustified the charge, Wikipedia must take care.  This is an encyclopedia first, but also a non-profit foundation existing on donations.  As editors, we have a duty to protect the reputation of the project.

This raises a second point.  There is a rhetorical error in your comment cited above that has little to do with logic, except perhaps the logic of human psychology.  Large groups are rarely coldly analytical, a fact I find unfortunate quite often.  Nevertheless, it is a fact to which a wise persuader should adapt. """"The death of a few readers...is...a de minimis deleterious effect...""""  This sentence is likely to win one more opposition than support, even if it be logical and empirically correct.  Those who think first from emotion might well react to such sentiment with alarm.

On the precedent of Seigenthaler, I understand why your opposition is showing extraordinary caution when confronting the spectre of a possible high-visibility """"press event,"""" ie. natural disaster.  Given your rhetorical misstep, I understand also why you might fail in this argument, even if the opposition were meritless (thankfully, they are not so.)  On balance, you are probably more correct; the case is not unambiguous, though.  Policies and guidelines exist as principles to be applied by the responsible community in its decision-making fora.  Very rarely, an underdeveloped discussion will ignore these principles, in which case, review (and chastisement) are warranted.  More typically, well-meaning editors apply principles as best they can to cases where principles conflict or overlap.  This case is an example of the latter, and you should waste no worry over the result. Best wishes,  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Okay, I'm going to try and explain this to you again.  There are a few points which you don't seem to be understanding, so I'm going to number them.
Infoboxes contain links to various sites which contain information.  For instance, an actor's infobox will often contain a link to their official web site as well as a link to their IMDb profile.  These are not meant as sources or references.  They are simply links to other reference type sites which are well known for their content as it relates to actors.  The reason that they are included is summed up on WP:EL which states in part """"... information that could not be added to the article for reasons such as copyright or amount of detail, or other meaningful, relevant content...""""  IMDb and IAFD go into a great amount of detail which we don't include.  This is why they are linked in the infobox.
IMDb, much like IAFD, cannot be used as a source for biographical information.  This is because there is little, if any, fact checking done for that information.  For instance, for my IMDb profile (yes, I have one and no, I will not share it with you since it has my real name), I could supply IMDb with a date of birth, ethnicity, and so on and claim to be me but they don't actually know that I am who I say I am.  The filmography on my profile though is supplied by the directors, production companies, etc. which have had me work for them on their films.  Filmographies come to IMDb from official sources.  IAFD works much the same.  Biographical information is not very well fact checked and comes from the average user/reader/whatever you want to call them.  Filmography info comes from the production companies.
You keep asking me for a source.  I don't have any other source than what is already supplied in the article.  If you go to Bitoni's article and look at the ethnicity in the infobox, you'll see a little number """"2"""" next to it.  That number refers to a reference in the references section of the article.  When you look there, you'll see that all the references are numbered.  Click on the second reference and that is the page that is being used as a reference for her ethnicity.  The """"a, b, c"""" that you see there means that the same source is being used for two other facts within the article.
That source is from Bitoni's publicist.  It's as credible as can be and is trusted.
There, now that I've explained all of this, do you have any questions?  If so, please explain which point you don't understand.  |(talk) """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, with a strict neutral point of view policy and that the self-introduction companies often give on their own websites will often not be accepted here.

Several editors here have opinions on which companies should have articles at all about them at all. Very many are uncomfortable with articles about small and obscure companies, and want only articles about companies which are notable. Some guidelines for what will make a company notable can be found at WP:CORP.
Please check that Auriga Logic meets, or at least comes close to meeting some of the WP:CORP guidelines to see whether a Wikipedia article on the company is worthwile in the first place.

His guildmates always come before him in the agit. He sometimes also shock and frighthened on what to do next, lacks command responsibility.. This again triggers for a breakup for the guild. And so, the evolution of a  new guild arises, ASHER.

ASHER

The last evolution of sas nigel's perseverance to create a guild. The guild's name is orginally derived from their first born baby, named Angelo Asher Ancheta. The baby is the source of all strength and power of the couple, and so naming for it in a guild is a good one..

Asher is composed of all star-break away guildmembers. One of it was deMonyiTa`~, [BS]Blackmith, milennia of Bad Boys, Rikku9, ...ommi..., † WardeN † of Majesty, and the rest of BANDITS members. 
This members have one thing in common, their school, except for ommi studying at Polytechnic University of the Philippines. deMonyiTa`~ is being recruited by p a o l o in an event, wherein he finds Autogame Cybershop """"home"""". Being fascinated with the idea of having one guild shop gives deMonyiTa`~ the wit to have an extension guild for asher.

ASHER: FIRST RPC
Asher, being a beginner guild for the RPC, tied up its allegiance with The Tyrants.. The Tyrants alliance is composed of Majesty, Dynasty, Ninja, WADAB, ASHER and MacWorld Clan.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

8dfddd7ae9d63a16,"""Hi, I'm . I'd like to personally welcome you and thank you for your contributions thus far. As you probably know, Wikipedia is a free encyclopedia collaboratively written entirely by volunteers. If you ever see anything that can be improved—be it correcting a typo or writing a new article—don't be afraid to fix it yourself! Don't worry about making mistakes; one of the many editors will probably notice and quickly correct it. If you have any questions, just place the text {{helpme}} on your talk page, and an administrator will help you shortly. Alternatively, you could join the #wikipedia-en-help IRC channel, where dozens of friendly helpers await. You can find out more about the project here, but I won't bore you with statistics and rules. Just remember to be civil to other editors, to always cite your sources, and to write articles from a neutral point of view, and you should be good to go.

Wikipedia is a huge website; with  articles, it is the single biggest encyclopedia in the world. Additionally, there are thousands of policy and process pages, so it can be a bit overwhelming, even to experienced users. When I was new, I found the Tutorial particularly helpful. You might also want to check out the glossary. This page serves as our library reference desk, where you can ask nearly any question imaginable.

The Featured Articles and Good Article pages are good places to look for some of our most well-written and comprehensive articles. On the other end of the spectrum, we have thousands of articles that require cleanup of some sort, so feel free to help out. In particular, many biographies of living persons need to be sourced properly; while this task can be a bit difficult, it's of a highly important nature.

I hope you've found this advice helpful. Feel free to contact me for more information. –'''''' | Talk """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Yep.  This is one of several cases where the vast majority of the time the pattern is met, it is indeed vandalism.  (I suspect something like 99% or better, but have no actual data behind that, so it's really just a guestimate.)  There are a small number of cases on this and some other of the bot's criteria that are actually false positives.  The error matches a vandalistic pattern, but is actually not vandalism.  In general it has been decided that this is a small enough price to pay for the good that the bot does in rapidly reverting the rest that are indeed vandalism.  In general the bot is supposed to run in Friendly mode, where it will not edit war.  This means that if you get hit by a false positive, just make the edit again and remove the warning from your talk page.  The bot should not revert a second time on the same edit.
 As for refining, that's tricky.  What was there about those two edits that a bot, a computer program, could have used to identify them as not vandalism?  Sure, the bot could be programmed with the very specific examples of those two edits, but the next time won't be exactly the same.  If we told it that """"CITATION NEEDED"""" was not vandalism, then the next time they used """"NEED CITATION"""", or """"CITATION REQUIRED"""" or """"FACT CHECK"""", then the bot would not catch it.  We cannot anticipate every single way someone might make this mistake.  The radio station edit is even more tricky.  And what about the edits that have nothing to do with citations or radio stations?  We would need solid criteria that would allow the bot to tell that one all-cap edit is vandalism while another is not.  And I for one have no idea what we could use.  New ideas for improving the bot are welcome, but in this case we need very specific ideas for rules that will help a bot tell the difference.  The bot is stupid, and only does what it is programmed to do, nothing more.  It cannot make judgement calls edit by edit. -  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

You are spot on Leladax. Some with a strong FYROM POV around here argue that 'Republic of Macedonia' is the only official name in use and wish to lock it in at Wikipedia.

While true many nations and NGO's have chosen in the interim to use """"Republic of Macedonia""""... all nations in principle agree to honour whatever name FYROM/Greece can hammer out. When it comes to Wikipedia itself all names should be used if NPOV was actually being observed... especially since the dispute is still ongoing.  Many countries around the world still officially use FYROM (including even the US which still uses both names at times (the US Senate resolution last year condemning FYROM actually used the FYROM name).

What I really think is missing from the article is that technically speaking FYROM is currently in breach of at least a few of its original UN brokered terms with Greece. (This incidentally is exactly why I the why the US government passed the resolution last year condemning FYROM for breaking terms,  why the Greek government vetoed FYROM's  recent attempt at NATO membership, , and why it will probably veto EU membership as well.)

Agreement Violation #1: FYROM was supposed to stick to FYROM for external use

FYROM citizens are now trying to be recognized exclusively as """"Republic of Macedonia"""" even though in Article 7 of the original UN brokered agreement (which their own leaders signed) specifically states

""""the Party of the First Part reserves the right to object to any membership referred to above if and to the extent of the Party of the Second Part is to be referred to in such organization or institution differently than in paragraph 2 of the United Nations Security Council resolution 817 (1993). (which is still be FYROM I believe)

Agreement Violation #2:: Refrain from propaganda against Greek cultural heritage and territory

Article 7 and 11 of the UN agreement between Greece and FYROM state:.

""""Each Party shall promptly take effective measures to prohibit hostile activities or propaganda by State-controlled agencies and to discourage acts by private entities likely to incite violence, hatred or hostility against each other.

If either Party believes one or more symbols constituting part of its historic or cultural patrimony is being used by the other Party, it shall bring such alleged use to the attention of the other Party, and the other Party shall take appropriate corrective action or indicate why it does not consider it necessary to do so.

The article should probably include a few real world examples to show the complaints are very real. I myself recently heard someone from FYROM claim Aristotle was actually Slavic on a forum but there are literally thousands of examples of irredentist behavior to be found. (a small subset of some recent examples that seemed relevant, verifiable and seemingly demonstrate the argument beyond the abstract) 

There exists a steady stream of FYROM supporters on the Alexander_the_Great article history page claiming Alexander wasn't Greek.  

Top ranked FYROM websites  almost universally are writing revisionist histories that suggest Alexander was not Greek  (quote taken from the website)
""""Contrary to modern Greek claims, Macedonia was never part of Greece, and the ancient Macedonians were not regarded as ancient Greeks.""""

Current FYROM Prime Minister welcomes Pakistan “Macedonian” Prince Ghazanfar  and uses it as """"proof"""" of their ancient Macedonian roots. That one really made me cringe considering not so long ago everyone was being assured by FYROM leadership...

'""""We are Slavs, who came to the region in the sixth century. We are not descendants of the ancient Macedonians.""""' Kiro Gligorov (FYROM's first President)

'""""We are not related to the northern Greeks who produced leaders like Philip and Alexander the Great. We are a Slav people and our language is closely related to Bulgarian... There is some confusion about the identity of the people of our country""""'. Gyordan Veselinov  (Canadian ambassador to Canada in interview to Ottawa Citizen in 1999)

(incidentally both quotes appear extremely relevant to the article. I tried to add them myself to the article but they were removed without justification. You are welcome to try.)

McMartin was one of several cases in the 80's involved in this debate. The best NPOV book on McMartin is Hechler, D. (1988). The Battle and the Backlash: The Child Sexual Abuse War. Lexington,Massachusetts: Lexington Books. This book covers both sides of the issue extremely well with interviews from the actual participants. Hechler's work has appeared in the NY Tinmes, the Village Voice and the New York Daily News. Earl is biased and so is Underwager's IPT. 

In regard to Prometheus Books, it has been stated on another wiki talk page:
""""Prometheus books is not a credible source on child sexual abuse. Their """"Human Sexuality"""" section throughout the 80s and 90s was edited by Vern Bullough, who is also a board member of Paidika, the Dutch pro-paedophile magazine. Under Bullough's editorship, Prometheus published a range of pro-paedopihlia titles, including the Eberles, as well as the book """"Children's sexual encounters with adults"""" in which a number of contributors espoused pro-paedophile views. I am astonished at the inconsistency with which certain Wikipeida editors attribute credibility to different sources on child sexual abuse. The Eberles' history with child pornography is in the public domain and it has been for almost twenty years. Now we find editors claiming that the Eberles (and John Earle, a contributor their book) are considered credible sources, whilst all sources (including major newspapers, magazines and a trial judge) indicating that they are child pornographers are not credible sources.""""

 The McIntosh et al. 2013 study on rotational acceleration and bicycle helmets 

I have restored the reference to this study in the """"Rotational Injury"""" section of the article - someone had removed it and substituted a reference to a another study by McIntosh et al. which deals only with motorcycle helmets. Unfortunately, it seems the publisher has made a mistake and the McIntosh et al. paper and one other paper are missing from the online journal contents (you can see the gap in the page numbers for that issue). The corresponding author is endeavouring to have that corrected, but the paper does exist, I have seen a copy of it. It isn't indexed in PubMed yet either.  In the meantime, I will post of a copy of the abstract from the paper here:
ANDREW S. MCINTOSH, ADRIAN LAI and EDGAR SCHILTER. Bicycle Helmets: Head Impact Dynamics in Helmeted and Unhelmeted Oblique Impact Tests. Traffic Injury Prevention (2013) 14, 501–508. online DOI: 10.1080/15389588.2012.727217. 
Objective: To assess the factors, including helmet use, that contribute to head linear and angular acceleration in bicycle crash simulation tests.
Method: A series of laboratory tests was undertaken using an oblique impact rig. The impact rig included a drop assembly with a Hybrid III head and neck. The head struck a horizontally moving striker plate. Head linear and angular acceleration and striker plate force were measured. The Head Injury Criterion was derived. The following test parameters were varied: drop height to a maximum of 1.5 m, horizontal speed to a maximum of 25 km/h, helmet/no helmet, impact orientation/location, and restraint adjustment. Additional radial impacts were conducted on the same helmet models for comparison purposes. Descriptive statistics were derived and multiple regression was applied to examine the role of each parameter. 
Results: Helmet use was the most significant factor in reducing the magnitude of all outcome variables. Linear acceleration and the Head Injury Criterion were influenced by the drop height, whereas angular acceleration tended to be influenced by the horizontal speed and impact orientation/location. The restraint adjustment influenced the outcome variables, with lower coefficients of variation observed with the tight restraint. 
Conclusions: The study reinforces the benefits of wearing a bicycle helmet in a crash. The study also demonstrates that helmets do not increase angular head acceleration. The study assists in establishing the need for an agreed-upon international oblique helmet test as well as the boundary conditions for oblique helmet testing.

 Laughable Errors""""The Qur'an also places a dress code upon its followers. For women, it emphasizes modesty. Allah says in the Qur'an, """"And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and guard their private parts and not to display their adornment (interpreted as the hair and body-shape) except that which ordinarily appears thereof (interpreted as the face and hands) and to draw their headcovers over their chests and not to display their adornment except to their husbands, their fathers, their husbands fathers, their sons, . . . ."""" (surat an-Nur verse 31). All those in whose presence a woman is not obliged to practice the dress code are known to be her mahrams. Men have a dress code which is more relaxed: the loins must be covered from knee to waist. The rationale given for these rules is that men and women are not to be viewed as sexual objects.

Turkey, a predominantly Muslim country, has laws against these dress codes in schools and work places. After the declaration of the Republic in 1923, as part of revolutions brought by Ataturk, a modern dress code was encouraged. It is against the law to wear a head scarf while attending public school in Turkey, as well as France, where the recently enacted rule caused huge public controversy.""""

 Hannibal 

Good Article it could use a bit of revising but we can worry about that later. Returning to the discussion about the coint,,,uhhh guys Hannibal is Phoenician(Caanite,Yemen Migrents) Caanite(yemen Migrents Berber(yemen Migrents) Carthaginian Arab

Berbers: 

Berbers are the original and first inhabitants of North-Africa, in other words, they are the natives of this part of Africa. The name by which they are called (berbers) comes from the noun """"barbarians"""" (in english). And this, because Romans used to call All those who didn't speak their language  """"barbarians""""... And actually, there are only us who are still called like this ^_~ why did they use this term, they just use this noun without any feeling of a pejorative meaning. But to call themeselves in their language (Tamazight), they use """"imazighen"""": the plural of """"Amazigh"""". 

Many people ask about our origins, and I always say that this question is sensless! it's like asking what is the origins of the Indians! Indians Don't have the same eyes as chinese but they are considered as asians so Just think about us (it's an order!) that We are berbers Thus we are Africans! 

Don't forget that those who first were called africans were berbers, when you study about Rome and byzantine at school, you've probably heard about carthage and africans? these africans were the great Phoenicians,Berbers (arabs). Hence the Carthaginian Arabs. 

But we can answer to which race the berbers belong to, As you know (I'm sure you don't know!^^') there are 3 races in the world: 

The Caucasoid race (Europeans, Jews/hebrews, Arabs ...etc.) 

The Negroid Race. (Blacks) 

The Mongloid Race. (chinese, japanese ...etc.) 

Berbers are predominately Caucasoid (berbers of the sahara are mixed with sub-saharans), Their language is close to the Language spoken by the old egyptians (Pharaohs...), in other words they speak an Afro-asiatic language (Hebrew, Arab, assyrian, Old egyptian, Berber...etc.) SEMETIC! XD 

To see how berbers look like click google 

To know how berber language sounds (through music) download this MP3 by clicking google 

The lands where berbers lived in the past, were from the west of Old Egypt to the Canary-islands, But now, Berbers constitute only 25% of the population in Algeria and 40% in morocco, the berbers of the canary islands (called guanches) are spanish now and they've lost their language.

Berber DNA Tested 

Genetical Studies begin to be done on berbers, Be happy! YIPEEE p 

Here is the Berber DNA compared to other ethnics: 

""""So far, our analyses have allowed a clear dissection of almost all NW African...paternal lineages into several components with distinct historical origins. In this way, the historical origins of the NW African Y-chromosome pool may be summarized as follows: 75% NW African Upper Paleolithic (H35, H36, and H38), 13% Neolithic (H58 and H71), 4% historic European gene flow (group IX, H50, H52), and 8% recent sub-Saharan African (H22 and H28)."""" (Bosch et al., Am J Hum Genet, 2001) * * * Caucasoid mtDNA (maternal) sequences, labeled L3E and U6, were detected at frequencies of 96% in Moroccan Berbers, 82% in Algerian Berbers and 78% in non-Berber Moroccans, compared with only 4% in a Senegalese population. (Rando et al., Ann Hum Genet, 1998) * * * 

While the origins of the Sumerians, whose language appears related to no known linguistic family, remain a mystery, the other people of the region were chiefly Semites - Canaanites (the Levant), Amorites (southwestern desert people), Akkadians and Assyrians (Mesopotamia), Arameans, Habiru (Hebrews) and Bedu (Beduin Arabs of the southern desert). The languages of these groups are closely related, and also related more distantly to Hamitic languages, which include ancient Egyptian, Coptic, and Ethiopian.

Throughout the Bronze Age there was a sporadic influx of nomads from Arabia into the area, hostile at first, but soon incorporated into the existing culture. Later, Indo-European peoples migrated into the area. Among them were the Hurrians, who moved from Turkey in the North to Iraq in the 3rd milleneum BCE and brought the light horse-drawn chariot and composite b",0,0,0,0,0,0

User:Bgwhite: I am surprised that Ontario's """"Reverted to a neutral version"""" edit (of course, it is neither a reversion nor neutral) was seemingly at your request.  If I had known I would have asked you to revert it instead of doing so myself (Dec.6), which has now brought me an accusation by Drcrazy on ANI of """"edit-warring"""".  My first priority is to get Ontario banned/blocked and the current forum for that is the ANI incident.  Until that is finished I do not intend to spend time elsewhere, most especially because I don't want to give anyone on ANI an excuse to say """"OK, they are discussing on the TP so there is no more need for this ANI, we can close it"""".  I am also surprised that you fell for Ontario's spiel on your TP and choose the """"PR in the broader family"""" section.  The question posed in the two DRNs and the ANI (""""basic dispute"""") would seem to be a more obvious topic, one that Ontario is intent on avoiding until I drop.  Having said all that I will point out that I have already criticized Ontario's table, on Sep.23 here.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Mudvayne

i'm not one to say """"hey guys you forgot my favorite band of all time in the history of the world""""(let me clarify, they are one of my many favorites, not the bestest ever), but i think that mudvayne would be a good addition. yes, they may not be hardcore full blown 100% prog by the defintion, but thats the same for a lot of bands in a lot of genres. consider nine inch nails, 'hardcore' industrial fans think that the NIN stuff is too 'mainstream' to be industrial, but it's undeniable that they are definatly industrial to some extent.
so what does everyone else think, prog or not? my basis is that they are very prog for the current mainstream radio rock music, even if they don't fit the definition as well as many other bands. i believe that they are a sort of representative of the genre to the more mainstream(much like nine inch nails and industrial).""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Unprotect Augusto Pinochet - See Talk:Augusto Pinochet. Veriverily isn't explaining his objections to text he keeps reverting over and over again.  
The page is already protected. Is this a request for unprotection?  
Yes, please unprotect this page.  
Sorry, but in spite of your efforts I don't think the discussion has reached enough of a resolution right now to avoid a resumption of the revert war as soon as the page is unprotected.  
Veriverily only chooses to lodge personal attacks against me as long as he manages to censor any facts that he feels might reflect negatively on the U.S. by means of a page protection. There cannot be a discussion unless the page protection is lifted. If we have to wait for Veriverily, the page might as well be protected permanently.  
Refer to the large number of people who have put effort into this article - Ed Poor, Cadr, Cantus, Eloquence - while 172 seeks to sabotage our efforts at working together and impose his own agenda.  The Talk pages are available, so one can see 172 is lying.  Although I have aired my frustration with 172 several times there, the issues have also been much discussed by me and others (i.e., """"only"""" yeah right).  As Cadr said on this very page ,  """"Agree with VV. A lot of constructive work was being done on the page; the problems are almost enitrely down to the user he mentions."""" (in ref to 172)  As soon as the protection is off, 172 will continue his activities.  V

Unprotect Augusto Pinochet. Cadr and Veriverily refuse to back down one inch, and no one else seems to be paying any attention. Is this page just going to be protected indefinitely?  

See brief discussion below and, for the patient, that at Talk:Augusto Pinochet.  It tells a very different story. - V 
To summarize, it is 172 who refuses to budge and alter one word of the intro he wrote.  All other parties have written several draft intros each to try to accommodate objections and concerns.  172 dismisses these efforts as """"partisan bickering"""" and """"bullshit"""". - V 
Veriverily's comments are misleading at best. """"All other parties,"""" according to Veriverily, are the users (Cadr, EdPoor, AstroNomer, and himself) voting in the minority in the most recent round of polling. His preferred version does not have a """"consensus"""" behind it. This was really the winning position in the poll: """"Yes, it should be asserted, in both the intro paragraph and the CIA role in coup section, and not marked as controversial.""""  
Consensus had been reached before 172 started trolling; the poll was started afterwards and brought in random buddies of 172.  The poll voters he cites consist mostly of users who had no role in editing or contributing to the page and visibly no understanding of the issues and were voting ideologically.  Even so, the margin was only 8-5, far from overpowering.  Furthermore, one does not vote on whether to be neutral. - V 

I wasn't  """"brought in"""" to vote. Nor was I voting """"ideologically"""", rather my vote was determined by my familiarity with the issues. Perhaps instead of attacking anyone who voted differently from him V V should present more compelling arguments  

Who am I attacking?  And saying I """"should present more compelling arguments"""" supports my supposition that you were not aware of the talk of these issues, because if so you would have seen the thousands and thousands of words arguing these very points. - V 

I wasn't  """"brought in"""" to vote, I wasn't voting """"ideologically"""" and I have made (minor) contributions to the article.
 

Regardless of who the poll may have """"brought in"""", I think part of the purpose of listing this page at Wikipedia:Requests for comment, where it has appeared quite regularly for a while, is to """"bring in"""" opinions from members of the community.

8e5792c728553a62,"Oh dear Rick, we are back your misunderstanding of what probability means.  I am not sure if we are allowed to discus this any more, perhaps it is OK on this page.

Richard confirms above that there are two interpretations of probability, Bayesian and frequentist.  Although they both should give the same answer to any exact question it is very confusing to flip interpretation in the middle of an argument.  I am happy to discuss the MHP using either model but let us start with the Bayesian perspective first.

To a Bayesian, probability is a state of knowledge.  That is the definition of what Bayesian probability means.  In the Bayesian model, what is not known does not exist.  That is not something  that I have just made up, I am sure Richard will confirm it or you can confirm it using WP or any good text book.  So, if the player does not know where the car is placed, or the host's door opening strategy, the probability of winning by switching is exactly 2/3.  It may be that the car is always placed behind door 2 and the host always opens door 3 but, if we do not know that, it makes no difference to our (Bayesian) probability calculation, which depends by definition only on the information that we have, .  The concept of average probability makes no sense, there is just 'the probability' which is based only on our state of knowledge.",0,0,0,0,0,0

In regards BSD and Anarchism and issues related to love and sex, those are far too tangential. If someone at one time asked a question about Jacques Cartier, does that mean we should have a link for him under see also? And remember, this article is not about a RBE. It's about the TZM's advocacy of a RBE. There's a huge difference. Criticism sections should be about TGM and their views. Not about the larger issues they bring up. This is the same as any other page. For instance, a religious organization could have a """"criticism"""" sections and include anything that might potentially fall under the broader discussions relating to religion (which could be a lot of things). Same thing goes for Further Reading. If there's a book or article dealing with TGM, then add them. Adding sources that just talk about RBE or broader social or economic issues is too broad.

The Rhode Island Philharmonic Orchestra is a professional orchestra based in Rhode Island which performs throughout Southern New England.  Founded in 1944, its current music director (as of July 2009) is Larry Rachleff. Based in East Providence, Rhode Island, its performing home is Veterans Memorial Auditorium in Providence.

In the 1960s, Erich Kunzel served as its assistant conductor.
As of 2010 the orchestra has attracted the likes of conductor Jahja Ling,  violinists Jennifer Frautschi, Karen Gomyo and David Kim and pianists Ilya Yakushev, Jessie Chang and Jon Kimura Parker to perform with the orchestra. 

Music school
The Rhode Island Philharmonic Orchestra is the only fully integrated professional orchestra and music school in United States. It has a major music school founded by Alan Fox,  which eduates over 14,000 young people and adults with music lessons of all ability levels and instrumentations with classes and ensembles. The educational program of the school spans not only classical music but extends into pop, jazz, rhythm & blues and advocates youth orchestras and big band ensembles.  The orchestra received a grant to support """"Music After Hours"""", a consortium with the Music School geared towards educating aspiring young musicians grades 3-5 children after hours. This was put into effect in 2001.In September 2008,  the Rhode Island Philharmonic Society established the Carter Center for Music Education and Performance, located Waterman Avenue in East Providence which has over 30 private studios, including  a jazz, rock and blues wing.
Every May, the orchestra puts on 4 education concerts at VMA and groups of musicians perform at schools and community centers throughout the year.

The time frames are relevant to discussions of the left-right political spectrum characterizations, etc. As pointed out in Great_depression#Germany, for example, the Great Depression had a severe impact on the unemployment in the Weimar_republic#Onset_of_the_Great_Depression, facilitating the rise of the National Socialist party, etc.
It would seem evident that monumental disasters like the Great Depression had an effect on the ideology of Fascism and other movements as well. I'm sure that the sources address these issues much more thoroughly than is reflected in our article. For example, the following paragraph cites no sources whatsoever, does not even include a Wikilink to the Weimar Republic article, and seems to be generally lackingThe events of the Great Depression resulted in an international surge of fascism and the creation of several fascist regimes and regimes that adopted fascist policies. The most important new fascist regime was Nazi Germany, under the leadership of Adolf Hitler. With the rise of Hitler and the Nazis to power in 1933, liberal democracy was dissolved in Germany, and the Nazis mobilized the country for war, with expansionist territorial aims against several countries. In the 1930s the Nazis implemented racial laws that deliberately discriminated against, disenfranchised, and persecuted Jews and other racial and minority groups. 連絡 見学/迷惑 """,0,0,0,0,0,0

The solution to this is very simple. Find a source which says this isn't genocide. If you can't, then the article can't say that it might not have been genocide. Do you think you're the only person who has ever wanted to write something that can't be supported by WP:RS? I can think of a hundred occassions when it has stopped me contributing something I consider blindingly obvious. But WP:RS is the only way to keep Wikipedia halfway honest.
To address your criticism of the article, I point out that governments, for obvious reasons, are reluctant to issue a direct order to commit genocide even if genocide is their aim. Even Hitler didn't issue a direct order to gas all of the Jews in Europe. That doesn't mean that the Holocaust wasn't genocide. They will also always claim that the genocide was quid pro quo, or an unavoidable part of a war they are committing. The Kosovo war is an excellent example of this.
But many people today seem to think genocide, brutal warfare, terror actions and large massacres are the same thing and can all be called """"genocide"""" when you like. No way. During the Rwanda war, Madeleine Albright famously said that genocide wasn't being committed, but that acts of genocide were. How many massacres make a genocide? You seem to think it is obvious that this episode of massacres did not add up to genocide. But the point at which many massacres become genocide is, tragically, subjective.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Might we want either a temporary hatnote or a """"see also"""" for the present humanitarian crisis? I came here expecting to find a link to that article, wherever it may be, and couldn't find any. -  | Talk 

.  (moult with my mallards) 

A lot of this coverage is over at Cyclone Nargis.  Sadly, there just isn't a lot of information out there since access to the country is so tightly controlled, and even the assessment teams on the ground probably don't have the information we'd expect to see.  

 Name 

in the article, some parts say Burma, and some say Myanmar.

I think we should calll it Myanmar, since it may not be recognized by many countries, but that is the official (inter)national name.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

Please read the tag at the top of the page.  The name is under dispute.  

 Moved the Page Move Protection tag to talk page 

There isn't really a need for the tag to be on the article itself. As was successfully argued regarding the """"dispute tag"""" previously, the tag itself doesn't help the article, and it being on the talk page achieves the same end.  

Having a warning on the front page shows that the article is in a state of flux.  Anyone who isn't particularly wiki-savvy wouldn't realize that there is an ongoing dispute and that the current version may well change in the near future.  The """"non-endorsement"""" of the current name of the article is a reasonable point to make.  I don't particularly care for either name, but making it look stable when it's unclear is kind of misleading to the reader.  

You're not making a lot of sense. The first sentence of the article notes the naming of the country. I believe you were involved with the discussion regarding the """"Dispute"""" tag, and it came to the point where the only sensible solution was to have it on the talk page. The same applies with this tag. It has nothing to do with honesty and I'd be insulted if I didn't assume good faith. Please reconsider your reversion, the last thing I want is an edit war of any sort.  

Look at the discussion on this page regarding the name dispute tag.  I wouldn't say that there was a consensus that removing the tag was the only """"sensible solution"""".
The statement is true and not misleading.  Neither staying nor moving are WP:SNOWBALL.
Protection tags are usually on the front page of the article.  See WP:PROTECT#Other_notes for talk page templates.
The tag deflects mastodons: Having the tag on the article itself sends a clear message to people who might just assume that the name is wrong and move it.
The tag shows that the current name of the article is not a consensus statement: Not having the tag implies to a casual reader that the current name is appropriate (not the current consensus because there is no consensus).
It seems kind of redundant to you or me since we've been staring at it for the last couple of weeks, but to someone who is not already involved it shows that the article is not stable.  I mean, I really don't care that much, but why is it so critical to take it off?

 Origin 
The evidence presented by the following paragraph does not convince me of the relation between the Orkhon script and the Rovás. I've heard that conclusion elsewhere, and I'm not necessarily doubting it, but I just don't see proof from the arguments made here:
""""Around 600 AD, the yet illiterate Hungarian tribes moved southwest from their earlier territories to the coastal region of the Eastern Black Sea. The Hungarian Runes are almost certainly related to the Orkhon or Turkic Runic script. 

Says who? 

""""This is supported by the Hungarian tribes' early geography propinquity [Is this supposed to be """"proximity?""""] to the Göktürks.""""

So what? At various times in history they were near Germanic, Slavic, Turkic, Mongolic, and maybe Greek peoples. It doesn't follow, from the evidence presented that the Turkic influence was the source of the writing.

""""Moreover, thirteen of the Hungarian rovás glyphs closely resemble characters of the Orkhon script.

Which ones? I don't count 13 convergences. I see a lot of resemblance in overall appearance between Futhark and Rovás; they seem to show a greater resemblance to each other than with Orkhon. Some prominent features of the Orkhon script are absent in Rovás, e.g. reduplicated characters, and the use of dots or other small characters detached from the main sign.

I'm not arguing that German Runes and Rovás are necessarily closely related; it's just that the evidence presented by this section of this article is hardly convincing. If someone can correct this, please do.  !""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Emancipation (1862) was closely tied to growing power of abolitionists as McPherson says:
By the beginning of 1862 the impetus of war had evolved three shifting and overlapping Republican factions on the slavery question. The most dynamic and clearcut faction were the radicals, who accepted the abolitionist argument that emancipation could be achieved by exercise of the belligerent power to confiscate enemy property. On the other wing of the party a smaller number of conservatives hoped for the ultimate demise of bondage but preferred to see this happen by the voluntary action of slave states coupled with colonization abroad of the freed slaves. In the middle were the moderates, led by Lincoln, who shared the radicals' moral aversion to slavery but feared the racial consequences of 
wholesale emancipation. Events during the first half of 1862 pushed 
moderates toward the radical position. One sign of this development was the growing influence of abolitionists. """"Never has there been a time when Abolitionists were as much respected, as at present,"""" rejoiced one of them in December 1861."""" [End quote from page 494  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

(Deitcher, David. """"Unsentimental Education: The Professionalization of the American Artist"""".) """"Portrait of Madame Cézanne and Femme au Chapeau, both of 1962, were among the first paintings in which Lichtenstein based an image directly on a picture by an illustrious predecessor, introducing the theme of art about art. Both are presented at two removes from the original. Cézanne's portrait of his wife is transposed, with significant but subtle alterations, from a diagram book, Cézanne Composition, published a quarter of a century earlier, Lichtenstein was amused by the oversimplified and paradoxical idea that a flat diagram consisting solely of thick black outline could be used to represent the Frenchmen's work, given Cézanne's insistence on eliminating contours from his paintings as incapable of suggesting the corporeal reality of the three-dimensional motif from which he was working.""""
(Deitcher, David. """"Unsentimental Education: The Professionalization of the American Artist"""".) """"The contradictory character of the Pop object was central to an unusually lively and revealing debate late in 1963. It was Lichtenstein's earliest Pop paintings that provoked this controversy which led critic Brian O'Doherty (also an artist, under the name Patric Ireland) to identify completely new class of object: the 'handmade readymade.' Reviewing the artist's second Pop show in the New York Times, O'Doherty labeled him 'one of the worst artists in America.' Nonetheless, he also credited him with creating paintings that 'raised some of the most difficult problems in art.'

Cézanne and Man with Folded Arms (both 1962), in order to excoriate some of the salient features of the new art.

(Deitcher, David. """"Unsentimental Education: The Professionalization of the American Artist"""".) """"Both Loran and O'Doherty thought it absurd that so many supporters of Pop were defending Lichtenstein by insisting that he 'transformed' rather than 'copied' his sources. Claiming that only an expert could discern the difference, O'Doherty found this hairsplitting quite beside the point. After all, it had been possible to classify direct appropriation as art since 1913, when that 'old master of innovation ,' Duchamp had 'started it all by setting up his readymades...and calling them art, leaving on us the burden of proof that they were not.' Both Loran and O'Doherty found the transformation alibi doubly annoying since it clinched the matter of Pop's high-cultural status by resorting to an altogether academic and contradictory dual defense. On one hand, Pop was art because it 'put a frame of consciousness around a major part of American life...we take for granted.' On the other, Pop was art because an artist like Lichtenstein transformed his sources 'like a good artist should'—a clichéd view of fine-art production.""""
(Deitcher, David. """"Unsentimental Education: The Professionalization of the American Artist"""".) """"For Loran, the 'transformation' or 'copy' debate was spurious: since the Abstract Expressionists had ventured 'far beyond the process of transforming nature' to produce paintings that presupposed 'no conscious source but have an identity and imagery that is autonomous,' transformation—even were it detectable in Lichtenstien's art— could only constitute aesthetic regression.""""
(Deitcher, David. """"Unsentimental Education: The Professionalization of the American Artist"""".) """"For different reasons, Lichtenstein himself shunned the transformation defense.""""

(Coplans, ed.) """"The idea of using a closely linked subject matter within a unified style of treatment is obviously suggested in the various paintings deriving from modern masters. Man with Folded Arms and Portrait of Madame Cézanne (both 1962) are quotations of outline diagrams by Erle Loran explaining Cézanne's compositional methods and are similar in the linear black-and-white handling of the imagery.""""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Second: what if every article were subjected to your line of thinking?

Well, for one, it would become pretty useless, don't you think?

On another point, the article includes a quote of Rawat's supposedly drawn from his first website:

In an article named Journey that he published in his personal website on January 1999, Prem Rawat writes about this apparent contradiction: People through the years have tried to place me in a mold, and from the very early years I have not been able to oblige them. When I was very young, people were looking for the """"old silver-haired Guru with flowing white robes."""" I was only eight. When people were flocking to India for their search, I was in the West. When people were looking for sophisticated discourses, I spoke of simple things. When people wanted nirvana, I said, """"You need peace."""" When people said, """"Tell us of the scriptures,"""" I said, """"Look within you."""" When people asked, """"What is your qualification?"""" I said, """"Judge me by what I offer."""" To this day, some people see me the way they want to. After all, I guess it is rather inconvenient to see things as they really are. I have evolved, but my message stays the same. Externally, I have changed but within me, something stays the same. In that same article Rawat states that people wanted to see him as a figurehead and as a leader but that he does not want to be one or the other, and that all he wanted to do is speak to those who wanted to hear him, and impart the Knowledge to those that sought it. He also said that if people like what is given, to practice it and if not, to leave it.[14]

However, the attribution link takes one to Rawat's current site instead.  If there is no proper attribution here, this passage should be deleted, no?

The version that you keep reverting to is at least as anti-contra as the other version is """"pro-contra."""" The irony is that while the Sandinistas themselves have been willing to admit their errors and have reached out to win the votes of former rebels and their sympathizers, some of their foreign supporters seem to be stuck in their circa 1986 vision of Nicaragua. Some Wikipedia editors are holding to views about the contras that even the Sandinistas don't believe anymore.

For instance, while pro-contra editors like to emphasize the role of the MILPAS, anti-contra editors prefer to emphasize the role of former Guardsmen. Yet even Envio, in its February 1987 review of the contra war, noted that Dimas' MILPAS rebellion was """"the most serious episode"""" of the early part of the war.

On the other hand, your favored version reads that """"many members"""" of the old Guard were involved in forming early groups like the 15th of September Legion. But even writers who were hardly pro-contra, like Christopher Dickey and Roy Gutman, have noted how tiny these groups were.

According to the wiki article on demonology, there are 133,306,668 demons and the bible says
1/3 of the angels fell from heaven and became demons.  Therefore, this would mean that there
are 266,613,336 good angels (i.e. 133,306,668 + 266,613,336 = 399,920,004 total good and bad
angels with the bad angels being 1/3 of 399,920,004)

Given that there are about 6 billion people on the earth currently, this would mean that
a guardian angel would have to have more than one person he/she/it is responsible for.
I assume that God would not assign someone a demon to be his/her guardian angel, so this
makes the number of possible guardian angels at maximum, 266,613,336.  Since the world
population is now 6,542,502,827 this would mean that each guardian angel would have to
be assigned 24 to 25 people.

Offensive images in article histories
OK, everybody knows that featured articles are frequently vandalized, and one of the more common infantile tricks is to insert some image, usually a penis, in the featured article.  These are always quickly reverted, but I wonder why the offensive images remain in the article's edit history.  For example, somebody inserted a photo of masturbation in today's featured article on Joseph Smith, and it is still visible when you get back that far in the """"compare selected versions.""""  Isn't there a way to just indicate what the vandal did (as is done with the ID of the image), and to remove the actual image itself from the article's history?  In general, that's a big problem with these """"selected versions"""" in the article historythat things like this remain and aren't completely removed/disassociated with the article.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Sorry, did Bastun just claim to be an outsider to this article?! Codswallop. Yes, I was sugesting Off2riorob was an outside opinion, since he'd never edited the article before. Are you suggesting that his opinion isn't valid because he posted before you, but if he was asked and he reiterated his previous comments that he'd then become an outside opinion? 

Have you actually read WP:NOTCENSORED? If you have, perhaps you could actually explain which part of it is relevant to your argument. You'll also find you've picked completely the wrong person to try that argument on in relation to this particular article, since I made the pages of El Reg in relation to a previous dispute where I was attempting to include well sourced details of Adams' rather colourful past. Naturally you might not have seen that, but a look in the talk page archives would have shown you the nature of the dispute.

There is no attempt to """"censor"""" this information from Wikipedia, it is currently sat in Gerry Adams Sr. without a problem. However there's no direct relevance to this article, since Adams states he has no recollection of being abused and wasn't aware of it until the 1990s. Why would we write about Gerry Sr. on the Liam Adams article, should it ever be created which I doubt will happen in the near future at least. That would be synthesis of the gravest order, attempting to imply a cause-effect link because one case of abuse and another when nobody has said Liam Adams was a victim of abuse by Gerry Sr. 

It would seem that Bastun is very much swimming against the tide of consensus, having failed to offer any cogent explanation as to exactly how this information is relevant to this particular article he's now making wild accusations of censorship. Tiresome. 303 """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Orbit of the Moon 

So apparently there are some sources that describe the Moon's orbit as convex, and some that describe it as concave.  People have a tendency to mix up the terms convex and concave.  Damn whatever idiot decided to use such similar words for such an obscure concept.  Rather than attempt to determine which sources have more authority, I suggest we look at the actual definitions of the words.  All the sources agree that the Moon's orbit has no loops.  And the Wikipedia article Convex and concave polygons seems to imply that a circle without loops would be convex, rather than concave.

Some of the sources describe it as convex/concave inwards vs. convex/concave outwards.  I think that distinction is nonsense.  Something is either convex or concave.  Convexity and concavity have no distinction with respect to inwards or outwards.  When they say that the Moon's orbit is convex """"with respect to the Sun"""" I think they just mean that as opposed to convex with respect to the Earth.

So I still think I'm right on this, and I'm not inclined to change my edit.  Except maybe to link to the article on the definition of convex, to avoid this misunderstanding in the future.  But now that I've expanded on my reasoning, if you still think it contains a mistake, feel free to let me know why. -   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

The problem of LTI is difficult because many BSEEs forget what it is after leaving class. So we have to be very grammatically careful to write clearly for even a technical audience. Memristors are linear when solving a circuit at one point in time, which is an important bit of linearity. Essentially LTI theory developed to describe what Fourier/Laplace transforms and LCR circuits and can do. So it's surprising to an EE that a fundamental passive element would not work in that theory. But it's not important to a non EE. So we have to phrase it such that a non EE will gloss over and an EE stops and says, """"what does that mean again?""""

I did not say what you repeatedly say I said. You have several times now said I should be blocked for calling somebody a """"cunt"""". You have repeatedly made false accusations against me without a single time providing a diff. I am well aware of what I have written and where it was written. I have not called you or anybody else such a word anywhere on Wikipedia. The most outrageous thing in the diff in which you were blocked for was not your reference to """"cancer"""". It is your persistence in spreading false and malicious commentary about me. In that diff you say When Nableezy had the balls to say that he knew someone was a sockpuppet but that he was keeping his mouth shut because he likes him it showed that he was here for one reason and one reason only. Post a diff that backs that comment up. Just one, try to find one. Later on you say this time he called people cunts. Could you please provide a diff in which I call people (pl) cunts (pl) or even a person a cunt? Of course you cant, but that doesnt stop you. I dont even care if you are blocked or not, I wanted an admin to make you stop making these outrageous accusations without providing any evidence. Earlier you made several allusions to various people who think I was socking. You back out of it by saying """"Im not the one accusing you, just other unnamed people do"""", as if that allows you to drop such an accusation with out one bit of evidence.The other problems with your comment aside, the accusation that you made that I """"breed cancer"""", that cancer being sockpuppetry, shows only how obsessed you are with directing fault to me. You think I am the reason NoCal or Dajudem socks? Really? I, hoping that I am right, will assume you say this because you are just unaware of the actual history, as opposed to purposely ignoring or distorting it. Much of this happened before my time here, but before I got involved in editing here I read a quite a bit of the history, through article and user talk pages and archives, AfDs, ANI, AE, AN3, ..., and the arbitration cases. So I have a certain familiarity with the actors of this play and know the story fairly well. Once upon a time, there was a user named Isarig. This user has had their account """"vanished"""" to . Some things I dont know, as the user's talk page is deleted, and others dont need to be discussed, but this user vanished at the start of the ARBPIA case. The user already had a history of socking, how much is one of the things I dont know. This happened late 2007/early 2008, with his last edit talking place on Dec 24 2007. NoCal100 was created Jan 3 2008. Canadian Monkey Dec 30 2007. Mr Hicks The III is an older sock, from Sep 2007. There were a few others created back then. All this before this monstrous creature you refer to as Nableezy arrived and caused this man to start socking.Now, as for your BFF (Stellarkid). The account Dajudem was given a topic ban after the CAMERA lobbying issue came to light in April 2008. One month later the Tundrabuggy account was created. One of the first things this account did was to go after, in a purely vindictive manner, one of the admins who had dealt with that issue. She, dishonestly posing as a new editor confused by the rules, was able to game the system into producing several blocks or bans against that admin. She followed him from article to article, going away from the A/I area into random areas such as Persian history. She was able to hide the fact that she was doing this for some time, until she was discovered as Dajudem's sock and blocked. One month later, a new account, Stellarkid, is created. Posing as a new account confused by the rules, this new sock proceeds to do the same thing she did with that earlier admin with a new target (guess who?). She is able to successfully get a ban placed against her target. When this account is discovered to be a sock, a new account (in fact several) was created. Three separate accounts were blocked last time around, including one with no edits just waiting to be put in to use. So Dajudem began socking prior to ever seeing me, yet I am responsible for her continued socking? And NoCal? I am responsible for dozen or so different accounts that I know that he has, and that isnt counting the ones from Isarig? How can you possibly blame me for the fact that a number of die hard members of the Defenders of the Glorious Cause have repeatedly socked?But back to the point, dont make accusations that you cant provide evidence for. Either provide a diff of me calling somebody a """"cunt"""" or retract the charge. Same for the accusation that I knowingly overlooked sockpuppetry because I liked a user. nableezy - """,1,0,1,0,0,0

I can agree with you on the religion part, but there are also a great many Spanish-speaking and African-American Christians, but I cannot ever recall a Lebanese marrying one of them, unless they were in Latin America of course.  Also, there are also non-Lebanese Arabic peoples who are not of a white appearance, but I still don't see them associating with these groups either.  James Zogby's site explains it all.  Just look at the list of 'famous arab-Americans.'  How come they are either mainly white looking or white's who do not identify, recognize or view themselves as Lebanese or Arabic?  It is more than clear what type of arab Zogby represents.  Now if his organization were called the """"White Arab-American Institute,"""" then I could go along with hime sense he would be truthful, but all arabs are clearly not represented.

 xenocide against me 

I am the foremost expert in the world on Ho-Chunk mythology, at least outside this N. American Indian tribe. There was a stub on this subject that had a short re-written excerpt from my website, so it occurred to me that since there was essentially nothing there, I could perform a service by writing an overview of Ho-Chunk mythology. I had spent three days carefully writing the first three sections of this with an enormous number of footnotes, when some hobbledehoy put in a section extolling the garbage-like ideas of my bitterest academic enemies. Fortunately, only a very small fraction of what I was going to write was entered. I assumed that if this outsider wanted to intrude in the middle of my project, that it would be alright to remove my part of the contribution and give him free rein to do whatever it was that he wanted in pursuing his competing thesis. It makes no sense to me to have a highly scholarly article riddled with severe inconsistencies. That I can't remove my very own contribution is infuriating. 

However, the good news is that my lawyer thinks that I have a good position on this. I took material out of my copy writted website with the thought that at some point I could say, """"reproduced by permission of the author"""". However, I hadn't yet gotten around to that when my article was destroyed by an ignoramus intruder. That means that almost all of it violates my own copy-write. Therefore, under the present circumstances, I not only may withdraw it, but I must withdraw it according to your own rules. I resisted these attempts to force me to surrender my writing to the encyclopedia by every means that I could think of. Except one, of course: a lawsuit for copy-write infringement. 

I'll make you a deal. I'll accept banishment gladly if you will return to me my own writing out of this STUB (!). 

Please contact me by my own email, as this site is pure chaos to me, and I don't think that I will be able to find your response otherwise.

Comments were left in regards to the redirect on the page Saves the Day and another editor has reverted the article, which  has redirected again, citing sockpuppetry and COI (but failing to leave any kind of comment on the relevant discussion pages).

I've been avoiding article work at the mo, as I can't entirely trust that my judgment is 100% sound, and I'm happier with making unholy messes in talk space than in article space ... heh! I think the fact that Alexander's BA thesis is quoted by other RS's, so Alexander himself is considered to be """"reliable"""" (as in expert-on-the-subject) by others of similar distinction.  Bearing in mind that his MA (or at least large chunks of it) is available """"reliably"""" at cited by others, I would think that would give sufficient oomph to his standing.  I can't imagine any but the most obsessively nit-picking and counter-productive editors would then question Alexander's reliability.  (At least, I sincerely hope they wouldn't!)

It happened so long ago and the situation was SO complex that I think no one really remembers completely correctly what happened. As far as I remember, it went something like this: the owner of Chernomorets Burgas bought Conegliano German (a team from a village next to Sofia) and for various reasons (mainly to get the Burgas team into a higher division without going through the proper means of actually gaining promotion - which is the same as what happened when Akademik Sofia swapped divisions with Vihar Gorublyane, actually, as well as a bunch of other teams such as Pirin Blagoevgrad) merged the two teams, which ended up being called """"Chernomorets Burgas (Burgas)"""" in Group B and """"Chernomorets Burgas (Sofia)"""" in Group A. Then a whole bunch of other stuff happened at the same time such as Burgas municipality founding their OWN team (which they called """"Chernomorets (Burgas)"""" - note the punctuation in all three cases); then a bunch of business deals went down whereby Neftohimik Burgas (which had since been renamed """"Naftex"""") got merged with Pomorie, then that team got merged with one of the Chernomorets'es, then the other Chernomorets remained as the """"official"""" Chernomorets, but still there was some dispute over players/grounds/finances...then that eventually merged with the first chernomorets; then the Sofia Chernomorets went back to being Conegliano German, then the Neftohimik fans formed a fans' club Neftohimik which began at the lowest level and... in short - before 2000 there was a Neftohimik and a Chernomorets in Burgas, and after 2010 there is a Neftohimik and a Chernomorets in Burgas. And between 2000 & 2010 a whole bunch of weird&random; stuff happened that I just don't know how to coherently explain. I reckon they can simply be mentioned in the Chernomorets Burgas and Neftochimic Burgas 1986 articles as something along the lines of: """"various business dealings led to the formation and dissolution of several clubs including """"Ch.B.B"""", """"Ch.B.S."""" and """"Ch(B.)"""" and, ultimately, led to the current state of the team"""".

Hello,

It's good to hear from you, my tuneful friend.

I am aware of the British custom of holding a commission in a """"home unit"""" while serving with the RFC. I used the term """"transfer"""" because Ball had given up his commission in infantry and carried his commission only in the RFC. Thus he was no longer """"seconded"""". However, he transferred from unit to unit. So, you see, there can be a slight difference between """"seconding"""" and """"transfer"""".

I am trying to bring Albert Ball up to Featured Article status as part of my cleanup effort. At present, I am wrapping up all my WP projects, so that I leave no mess behind. After that I don't know...the assessment rules of the WP game make for a game I feel is not worth playing, and being only a mere writer among all the code monkeys is wearing. And I do have a final draft of a novel to work upon, and the concept of another....

But, as I said, good to hear from you.

  

My point was simply that while one source may say """"transferred"""", and another """"seconded"""" there is in practical terms no real difference between what happened in either case, and hence no need to either edit or revert an edit to switch beween the terms. """"Transfer"""" is possibly the clearest term for modern readers, although original sources generally prefer """"seconded"""" when they talk about transfering between branches of the service rather than specific units. Never heard of anyone """"giving up a commission"""" in the army to join the RFC - it wasn't a separate service until after Ball's death so this just doesn't make sense. Never mind - not as if any of this matters, it was just a thought.
Sorry to hear you are getting WP burnout - happens to us all sooner or later I fear. Good luck with the novel. Is it based on your own service years?

Thanks on improving the NPOV of An Inconvenient Truth
Thanks for rebalancing the NPOV equilibrium of this article.  You have achieved by adding rebuttals within the science section in homeopathic doses what I could not by being I gather too straightforward.  I contributed a huge amount of research that was immediately taken out by MastCell.  I just gave up and placed a NPOV tag on this one-sided article at the time.  The tag lasted no more than 2 hours, as it was promptly removed by ILike2BeAnonymous (who is deemed by Wikipedia to be a saint as he apparently as protected many articles against vandalism).  But, ILike2BeAnonymous removed the NPOV tag without making a single contribution to rebalance the NPOV equilibrium.  I gather he thought my tag amounted to vandalism.  Finally, you courageously stepped in.  As you can see per the Discussion history you must be the third or fourth editor who is taking a rebutting balanced stand towards this article.  Of this group, I congratulate you for being so far the most successful.  

If I may, I would encourage you to do even just a bit more.  An Inconvenient Truth's main message is that because of anthropogenic CO2 emission temperatures will rise by the end of the century leading to a probable (entire) melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice caps leading to sea level rise of 20 to 40 feet submerging our seashore civilization as we know it.  The slides showing what such a sea level rise looks like (maps of cities, states, countries) are pretty dramatic.  But, they have absolutely no scientific bearing.  The IPCC forecasts a sea level rise ranges from several inches inches to just 3 feet in the worst case scenario.  I think this is a critical balancing point to insert within the science section of the article.  I have tried, and got censored immediately.

On the same subject, I am glad you came across the pretty impressive document """"A Skeptic's Guide to an Inconvenient Truth.""""  It is incredibly well researched and referenced.  By the end, there is hardly a page of the book or slide of the movie that is not effectively rebutted by data based scientific studies.  Keep up the good work. """,0,0,0,0,0,0

The current page is a work of twisted words and opinions and is not acceptable to any fairminded person. . I have a proposal to normalise things here. Forgive me but it is a Moldovan solution.  Take a look at the Moldova main space and you will see an interesting list of headings for the topics in keeping with the way most otherr states are dealt with. Then, take a look at the headings for the Transnistrian page and you'll see a marked difference. I suggest that the editors work under an agreement of equality and respect. Under this agreement headings are by dual agreement using Moldova as a template. For example, the Intro appears on both pages and should stay, as should ; Names, Geography, History, Politics, International relations, Economics, Human rights, Demograpghics, Economy , Information technology, Culture, Gallery, External links.  Headings that are parachuted onto the Transnistrian page that are under dispute be removed, This includes all the Smuggling, Crime, and Travel Warnings. That is assuming the Moldova page would prefer not to have such heading on that page. Under this each side is treated with equal rights.

As to redirects, you are right. No rules prohibit creation of redirects from sensible titles. """"Sensible"""" is pretty much inclusive and a redirect from Ancient Rus is alredy created. The types of redirects that are not allowed would not be created in good faith anyway. Under whatever name you think this may be found in English or whatever name you think the reader  looking for this article might enter into a search string, redirect is always a good idea. What's not allowed are only redirects that are POV pushing through promotion of POV term or non-existing term. Like it's not OK to make Little Russian a redirect to Ukrainian and instead the redirect should be to Little Russia, an article about the etymology and usage of the term. You cannot also invent a term and start pushing it into usage by creating a redirect article under it. Most of the rest is not a problem. Ancient Rus redirect is certainly a good idea.

And on November 30, 1864, there occurred near Grahamville the battle of Honey Hill. For Beaufort District, it meant the beginning of the end. 
Many stories of this battle have been told and written. An authentic and complete account was written in 1899 by Captain Ben Williams, of Brunson, who was a participant, was then adjutant of his regiment. His articles were published in the News and Courier and in the Hampton County Guardian. 
Outnumbered five to one, a little band of South Carolina cavalry, infantry and Citadel cadets faced a Federal naval expedition which had advanced up Broad River and disembarked at Boyd’s landing (or Salvesberg, the local name). The enemy’s destination was Grahamville Depot; their real objective the destruction of the railway track according to Sherman’s orders. 
With seven guns, a well-built breastwork, and the superb strategy of Colonel Charles Jones Colcock, who commanded the Third Military District of the state, the little Confederate band inflicted on the invaders losses amounting to nearly 8oo in a few action-packed hours. Colonel Colcock was everywhere, according to other officers. He even enlisted a strong, blowing wind on his side, having his men to fire a field of broomstraw, so that the flames were hurled into the faces of the enemy at a critical moment. Reinforcements of Georgia Reserves arrived from Savannah hours later, under General Gustavus W. Smith, but the general refused to take over the actual command from one whose ability and success had proved so outstanding. Tales have been told by many elderly local people of the surrounding roads literally running with Negro blood, because more than half the Federal force was made up of Negro regiments trained at Hilton Head. """"You could walk on dead Negroes for miles,"""" they declared. Old manuscripts tell further of bodies hastily buried in trenches; of later washing rains exposing a gruesome welter of arms and legs. These bodies later received decent burial in the Federal cemetery at Beaufort. 
An interesting side light on this battle is the fact that a local Negro, Allen Orr, participated. (He was proud of his service on the Confederate side). As a teen-age boy he went into this battle in which so many of his race were slain, """"Went with a white friend to take care of the horses."""" He lived until a few years ago. At the age of 100 years-plus, he enjoyed giving a pantomime of the manner in which he dodged behind the breastwork as the bullets were flying. The breastwork is evident for all to see. A number of cannon balls have been excavated at the site.""""""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 The reasons I dont contribute to Wikipedia anymore 
Reversions like the one you just executed on the psychology template presuppose a knowledge of psychology.  I must imagine that if you don't understand why the template is inadequate then you have not the faintest idea of what constitutes pscyhology. It is a) an academic (taught) discipline, b) a research discipline, c) an applied discipline, d) a profession, interest group and lobby e) a property of of social perception or a folk psychology if you like and f) an aspect of the humanities and the social sciences as well as a peer of psychiatry, social work and in some respects occupational therapy; g) a contested political terrain (which you would understand if a non-amateur had written the articles on critical psychology and cultural-historical psychology). Neither the template nor the main article bring out these distinctions. Instead what you have is a bad summary of a first year textbook of an American perspective on the psychodynamic-post- Skinnerian model of psychology circa 1950s. Having to explain this and to persuade you is hardly what someone with advanced expertise in the area wants to be doing on a Saturday afternoon. It is insulting, demoralizing and a waste of time. I imagine that the net sum of your expertise can probably be located at the lower end of a) or e) in which case you are probably enthuisiastic about your ignorance. So thank you for giving me one more reason not to contribute to wikipedia.

The above user who commented that a user who removed info regarding the punk rock article is absolutely misguided. That user is me. I never once posted that alternative rock did not come from Punk. I suggest that you get your facts straight. What I said was, grunge is not punk. I have been a hard core punk and a neo-punk since 1979. Since the early '90's, I've been involved in trying to revive punk during the grunge period of the 90's decade (while separating ir from influences of grunge). 

I will be blunt and unapologetic again... Punk IS NOT grunge. Never has been and never will be. Obviously from your answer, you do not know anything about punk, its fashion, history, or its influences. Punk is a genre in and of itself. It didn't spring from anything known at the time it was born; it obviously didn't come from disco and it certainly was not influenced by hippy music. I should know, since I have almost 30 years experience as a punk, have conversed with the inner circle of the punk greats, and even made recommendations to them in the early 80's.

Also it would have to be paired with fact that the specimen (almost exclusively associated with Y-DNA R1a1) from South Siberia and Kazakhstan (*) had almost exclusively mtDNA haplogroups of west eurasian/european origin especially during bronze age (as far as 1,800 BC). If we link that with the europoid phenotypes with light-colored eyes and hair and pale skin of andronovo south siberians described in the recent article of human genetics 
( http://www.springerlink.com/content/4462755368m322k8/ ), that's meaningful and favors an European origin of these R1a1. 
Especially since no south Asian haplogroups are linked to the spread of R1a1, up to Europe. 
.
Pretty meaningful, especially since such phenotypes are found where high frequency of R1a1 are found in Asia (like 
Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, east Afghanistan and north Pakistan) -> examples of such clearly europoid phenotypes in these regions of Asia that matches the description of south Siberian of Bronze age (andronovo culture horizon),

 Book Character Pages 

Sorry, I wasn't aware that I had to have the whole page written up before I created it; I figured I could ticker on it and """"build"""" it. As for having a """"Characters"""" main page like you were suggesting, I was going to do just that, using the page created for the Stargate Film Novels as the root. As for the books, it doesn't matter if they weren't very popular and not a lot of people know about them; that's all the more reason to add them to Wikipedia, so that we can present as much information as possible.

Also...I get the vague feeling that you're intentionally trying to harrass me whenever I edit ANYTHING film-related. Look, if you want to like SG-1 I don't give a damn, but I'm allowed to like the film and give as much information on it as possible. If you're truly """"not biased,"""" then why support a monopoly of SG-1 over the Stargate universe, giving NO coverage to the film?? You may not actually be doing that, but is sure as hell seems like it. And since the film books aren't even canon (yet), then why are you so touchy about those, too??

Such a list contradicts WP:NOT a directory. The article should discuss the key features that make this article stand out from any other shopping centre - and ideally, any other Westfield shopping centre.

In particular, stealth technology had advanced to the point that high lift, high angle of attack aerodynamic shapes could co-exist with stealth requirements. This was a significant evolution from the first generation stealth aircraft represented by the SR-71 and A-12. Second generation stealth as evidenced by the F-117 had yet to allow aerodynamic efficiency to co-exist with stealth. Only with the third generation of stealth inherent in the B-2 bomber were we able to achieve efficient aerodynamic shapes with a low radar signature."""" http://www.ausairpower.net/API-Metz-Interview.html

Nonsense. Yes of course there were constitutional amendments in July but those occurred all the time in the previous 45 years, they are hardly a relevant turning point of some sort. When I mentioned constitutional changes I was referring yo the new constitution, which might be taken as a relevant date. And no, the office of prime minister was not """"established"""" in the summer of 1990, it was merely renamed, or I should say the government was renamed, the only change instituted with the amendments was that the """"President of the Executive Council"""" now became the """"President of the Government"""".
That is purely your own judgement. The point of the matter is that democratic amendments were instituted by the Sabor (""""communist functionaries"""") before Mesic came to power. And that his position was not elective, but appointed - by Tudjman.

 The Gamergate Conspiracy 

We have discussed at some length above whether Gamergate should be described as a """"controversy,"""" as we do now, or as a """"movement”, as Gamergate supporters apparently prefer.  The sources clearly have a hard time finding the precise language to use here. So do we. Let’s look at all the options.

A movement is “a group of people working together to advance their shared political, social, or artistic ideas.” The members, or the leaders, of a movement are identifiable people, and the shared ideas are typically put forth in a manifesto or platform. Examples include the labor movement, the temperance movement, the Impressionist movement, and the Chautauqua movement. Even the resistance movements of the Second World War were characterized by organization; indeed, organization is what distinguishes an “organized resistance,”  and a resistance necessarily adheres to stated principles.  Gamergate lacks leadership, organization, or a statement of principles. Gamergate is not a movement; nomovement come to mind that lacks either leadership and manifesto.

A controversy is “a dispute, a prolonged public disagreement.” Controversy surrounds Gamergate; indeed, that controversy has made Gamergate notable. Some have argued here at some length that, while controversy surrounds Gamergate, Gamergate is not a controversy. They do have a point: our sources do write of “Gamergate supporters,” but no one writes about “Watergate supporters” or “Tea Pot Dome supporters.”    Our current lede uses “controversy” as a generous fiction: it's not perfect, but it’s been satisfactory for some time and I have no strong objection to maintaining it.

We do have a word that does apply rigorously to Gamergate as it is described by the sources: that word is conspiracy A conspiracy is “a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful,” and this is precisely what our sources describe.  Gamergate’s absence of visible leadership and the lack of expressed principles aren’t compatible with the behaviors of movements but are, of course, quite common in conspiracies from Alcibiades to Cataline and onward.

“Plot” might be an alternative to “conspiracy,” though it is probably even more pejorative. “Scheme” would also work in its American usage, but its use in British English to describe a governmental or institutional programme would cause confusion.  “Crusade” captures the fervor of Gamergate’s supporters and the violence of their sentiments, but crusades have a stated goal. Likewise, Gamergate cannot be a “campaign” or a “drive” as it lacks an objective toward which to it steer. “Cabal” is possible, I suppose.

But “conspiracy” is precise. “Conspiracy” also lets us finesse the problem of Gamergate being said to “claim” to be a movement. Who can credibly assert that claim? Someone might claim that Gamergate is a clam, or a festival, or a joke: how should we judge? If someone claims it’s one thing, and someone else claims it’s not, how do we distinguish?  In two ways: WP:RS and WP:FRINGE.  Following the latter, it’s hard to see that Gamergate can be made to fit the definition of “movement,” but it clearly fits the definition of “conspiracy” perfectly.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Copyright violation at Sarat Chandra Pandit 

Avoiding copyright problems
Hello, and welcome. Your addition to Sarat Chandra Pandit has had to be removed, as it appears to have added copyrighted material to Wikipedia without permission from the copyright holder. While we appreciate your contributing to Wikipedia, there are certain things you must keep in mind about using information from your sources to avoid copyright or plagiarism issues here.

You can only copy/translate a small amount of a source, and you must mark what you take as a direct quotation with double quotation marks ("""") and a cited source. You can read about this at Wikipedia:Non-free content in the sections on """"text"""". See also Wikipedia:Referencing for beginners, for how to cite sources here.
Aside from limited quotation, you must put all information in your own words and structure, in proper paraphrase. Following the source's words too closely can create copyright problems, so it is not permitted here; see Wikipedia:Close paraphrasing. (There is a college level introduction to paraphrase, with examples, hosted by the Online Writing Lab of Purdue.) Even when using your own words, you are still, however, asked to cite your sources to verify information and to demonstrate that the content is not original research. 
Our primary policy on using copyrighted content is Wikipedia:Copyrights. You may also want to review Wikipedia:Copy-paste. 
In very rare cases (that is, for sources that are public domain or compatibly licensed), it may be possible to include greater portions of a source text. However, please seek help at the help desk before adding such content to the article. 99.9% of sources may not be added in this way, so it is necessary to seek confirmation first. If you do confirm that a source if public domain or compatibly licensed, you will still need to provide full attribution; see Wikipedia:Plagiarism for the steps you need to follow.
Also note that Wikipedia articles may not be copied without attribution. If you want to copy from another Wikipedia project or article, you can, but please follow the steps in Wikipedia:Copying within Wikipedia.

It's very important that contributors understand and follow these practices, as policy requires that people who persistently do not must be blocked from editing. If you have any questions about this, you are welcome to visit me at my talk page .  Thank you. """,0,0,0,0,0,0

8fd9b36b591dbb48,"Specific points of fact

There seem to be two issues of fact in question:

 Which instruments are correctly called ten-string guitars?
 How many resonances are missing from the six-string guitar?

Viktor maintains that the twelve-string guitar is also incorrectly named, which is the issue on which we first crossed swords. I did not at first understand why it was so important to him, but later I discovered that he believes and argues strongly that only Yepes-tuned instruments and some nineteenth-century harp guitars are correctly called ten-string guitars. Obviously, if a twelve-string guitar is validly called that, then for example a baroque guitar might be called a ten-string guitar, and his chance of having non-Yepes-tuned instruments excluded as he wishes is remote. 

So far as Wikipedia is concerned, the main question is this: What should be the scope of the article at ten-string guitar? It seems to me that, under WP:NC, it certainly includes instruments that are built and sold by Ramirez and Bernabe to identical specification to the ones that they built for Yepes, but fitted with a different 7th string (only) to accomodate a different tuning. In fact I would also include any other guitar called a ten-string by its maker, such as the B.C.Rich Bich 10. And if we include that, then where do we draw the line? Wherever that might be, it won't be where Viktor wants it I'm afraid.

So far as resonances go, Viktor has raised this in many other forums. In the ten-string guitar Yahoo! group he was recently asked to list the resonances of the six-string guitar, to clarify what he meant by a similar essay to the one above. He listed nineteen of them!

The point is simply, resonance in this context is not well enough defined to enable us to count them and arrive at a unique answer. Whether we describe the eight missing notes (pitch classes), supplied by four resonant strings, as four resonances or as eight is academic.

Marlow may well be wrong on many other things. We all make mistakes! But this particular issue is a non-issue. Viktor's real problem with Marlow is simply that she is popularising a set of tunings for the Yepes guitar which he does not like.",0,0,0,0,0,0

MAGHASITO 2

USer:Maghasito try to spread of pseudo science, the so-called Hungarian Turanism , which is now a politically motivated chauvinist pseudo-science from the 19th century and a core agenda of far right Jobbik party and ww2 nazi Arrow Cross Party . There are not a single contemporary scholar (academics university professors) linguistics, historian, population geneticist on this planet, who support that fantasy theory. Wikikpedia is a free encyclopedia, however it is not the place of the popularization of pseudo-scientific politically-motivated fantastic nonsenses. The best option would be the permanent ban of Maghasito. Thank you! 

I believe that he is from a worker class family (as most of the Turanist believers), he migrated to UK or USA as a an economic-refugee due to the economic crisis. Many of this turanist boys read the esoteric pseudo-scientific  books of the so-called self-appointed turanist """"shaman-scholars"""". These shaman """"scholars"""" are usually electricians, blacksmiths, masons, car-mechanic in the real life, so they have no any university degrees. These less educated worker-class boys admired them as knowledgeable expert. Just read our discussions in the talkpage of Hungarian turanism: Forexample he consider Ferenc Zajti (shaman-scholar) as one of the greatest historian, Zajti was who invented the theory of Parthian - Hungarian Jesus. (according to Zajti Jesus Christ was not a Jew but a proto-Hungarian). These turan-believer-boys are often racist, they consider the Indo-Europeans and Semitic people and their culture as inferior and subhuman who created a very low primitive culture, and they consider the culture and race of Central Asian nomadic Turkic people as superior culture and race.

 Question about number of edits 

Hello, since the welcome message to my talk page came from you, I presume you're the person I should turn to with any questions.  I notice that every time anyone makes a change in an article, the old and new versions are stored in the history page.  I'm not terribly computer literate, but it seems that that would take up a lot of space, and I presume Wikipedia doesn't have infinite webspace.  If I see an incorrect comma in the third paragraph, a spelling error in the fifth, an incorrect link in the sixth, an incorrect date in the eighth, and unclear wording in the thirteenth, does Wikipedia prefer that I do one big edit so that it will have only one new page to store, or is it okay to save as I go along?  Are the individual versions in the history page deleted after a certain length of time?  I've been editing my user page, and just wonder whether I should leave changes until I have something big to change.

Thanks

 (Butting in here, again, as people ask more interesting questions on Mel's talk page than on mine).  Ann, firstly, diskspace is so incredibly cheap that you could type flat out for your whole life and you wouldn't fill a drive that cost 100 euros;  so don't worry about diskspace.  This issue of what to do in an individual edit is one purely for the convenience of other people who are reading it.  So if you're doing a bunch of fairly trivial tweaks (fixing grammar, spelling, formatting, etc) then do all of those in one go (and give an edit summary like """"various grammar and spelling tweaks"""".  If the article needs tweaks and also need a higher-level change (adding or removing a big chunk of text, fixing some wording that you thing is seriously incorrect or misreading) then do the trivial fixes in one edit, and the other fix in another (with an edit summary like """"removing nonsense about Father Dougal"""").  So (in summary) make changes based on what is a logical unit, not what's convenient for the software.   (talk | contribs) 21:35, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)

 Where do these concepts come from? 

The article was recently revised to say that Old Town is """"in Williamson County, near Franklin"""" (no longer """"in"""" Franklin) and that the mound complex """"is alongside the Harpeth River on what later became one branch of the Natchez Trace"""" (no longer simply """"on the Harpeth River branch of the Natchez Trace"""").

I'm puzzled by these changes, which aren't sourced. My investigations (call them """"original research"""") using online maps do indicate that Old Town is in northwestern Williamson County, near Franklin, but not inside the current city limits or even in the urban growth boundary. Thus, I think the geographic location is OK, even though sources have placed it """"in"""" Franklin. 

Let me get this straight.  You want to use insulting language about the edits, but then agree that they are factually correct.  Where is the OR?  I disagree that it is OR to state that the location is in Williamson County.  Whether or not it is currently in the current city limits is a factual matter that I am not actually sure about, but in the historic sweep it is correct to say that the location is near Franklin (think of Franklin having been a small town at one time).  It is """"near"""" Franklin, meaning it is not in modern downtown Franklin.  I see no OR.  

However, I can't agree with """"is alongside the Harpeth River on what later became one branch of the Natchez Trace"""". First off, what is later than """"is""""? It appears to me that the mound complex """"is"""" alongside the Harpeth River and """"is"""" on the Harpeth River branch of the Natchez Trace. I surmise that the intent was to say that the site was not on a branch of the Natchez Trace when the mound complex was built, but I don't buy that. First off, the previous version of the article never said that the mound complex was built on the Harpeth River branch of the Trace; it merely said that it's there now. Secondly, I'm not aware of any source indicating that the mound complex was not built on the Harpeth River branch of the Trace. Notwithstanding whatever the current version of the [[Natchez Trace[[ article, it's my understanding (based on diverse sources) that the Trace (which is an interconnected collection of trails, not a single trail) existed for centuries before white people laid eyes on Tennessee, and that archaeologists who have investigated Old Town assume that it was located where it is because of the river, the Trace, and the crossing of Brown's Creek. If the intent was to say that the Trace did not exist when the mound complex was built, I see that as a piece of WP:OR that's inconsistent with many sources.   

Those amendments to the article were in 2 edits, the main one with edit summary """"revise about assertion of location, avoiding unnecessary disclosure and avoiding synthesis (e.g. about 2 creeks being the same, not in a source AFAIK). Drop dup cat."""".  Funny you should be making accusations of original research.  I think the wp:OR accusation should apply more strongly to the previous language, which included wp:OR in the form of synthesis (wp:SYNTH?) about which creek is what (and the synthesis ends up disclosing more about location than is necessary).  I think that """"the Harpeth River branch of the Natchez Trace"""" refers pretty clearly to that branch of the 1800's Natchez Trace, which served as path/roadway for return upstream of persons who had brought rafts or barges down the Mississippi to New Orleans.  The other branch is known as the Ridge Route or something like that and is covered in a different NRHP listing.  These two distinct branches are known in history and described in historical documents, including being described in Williamson County MRA and other documents that Orlady has read.  To refer to the prehistoric mounds having been built along the 1800s-era historic """"Harpeth River branch of the Natchez Trace"""" is wp:OR, wp:SYNTH, ahistorical, sloppy, generally bad, in poor taste, and whatever else sounds negative, more so than the language which replaced the original language.

OR is bad.  OR was removed by the edits.  OR was not introduced by the edits.  Yay!  Glad we are all agreed.  I am sure there are improvements to the language which can be made, but I would prefer not to argue small wording changes until the bigger article structure questions being discussed above are settled.  Or until Orlady agrees to allowing a third party to judge on wording, and replies about participating in mediation to address the long pattern of conflict. ncram """,0,0,0,0,0,0

There appears to be some sensitivity with respect to this topic, which I think is due to an anthropomorphic bias.  Dysgenics is a research topic in biology; the anthropological and sociocultural aspects are not central to the topic.  The concerns listed in the heading paragraph belong lower in the text, as they apply only to the aspect of the term relating to homo sapiens.  

(and I want to add)

The concept of dysgenics itself is really only at home in a discussion of genotype.  Direct anthropomorphic considerations (of the sociopolitical aspects outlined in the article) are very crude constructions which do not hew to the precise biological use of the term.  I think one danger is that, by focusing on the easily politicized extension of the term, we risk conflating an important biological concept with indirect sociological constructions.  Next thing you know, biologists innocently researching fruit flies get implicated in fascism, eugenics, and gas chambers.  So I agree that we need to make very careful use of these terms.  These concepts, while connected to a degree, should be covered carefully. 137.186.41.143

 Bhojpuri language 

Bhojpuri language is more similar to Awadhi, Braj and Hindi than Magahi or Maithili. And actually i'm unable to provide any citation due to lack of proper categorisation and consideration by authorities and so there's no published record. But if you want, i can prove my point.. Better let me do.
For example, if i've to say, """"What is you name?"""" in bhojpuri, it'd be, """"tahaar naam kaa ha?"""" in awadhi, it is, """"tahaar naam kaa hai?"""" in hindi, it is, """"tumhara naam kya hai?"""" in braj, it is, """"tahaar naam kaa hai"""", and in magadhi, it is """"tor naam ki helthi?"""" in maithili, it'd be, """"aahank naam ki chhe?"""".

Disputing """"Job Guarantee"""" Section
Chartalists don't guarantee a job.  They merely argue that the role of government in cases of underutilization is to provide the necessary demand to resolve that situation, since otherwise you have unused capacity and net economic loss.  It's quite a jump to take that and conclude the government hires everyone who isn't employed; in fact, it often means the government becomes the customer of a lot of businesses.  If you are in a state of underutilization that represents an economic loss, and it's due to a demand problem, it means you must have some net fiscal expansion from some source in order to drive utilization.  If the private sector is attempting to build assets (run a surplus) and you have an external deficit, the only mathematical means of accomplishing this is public deficit, that is, the government is either hiring people or buying from the private sector.  So the section I've marked for expert review needs to recognize that Chartalists prescribe that government deals with unemployment not by guaranteeing a job, but by hiring more and/or spending i.e. buying more from the private sector.  Things could easily, and likely would, weigh more towards the second option.   (posting on behalf of one Filburt)""",0,0,0,0,0,0

My two main suggestions are to make smaller improvements to the article and to use more than one source. Unless you are very skilled at proper paraphrasing, using a single source greatly increases the risk of close paraphrasing, i.e. improper paraphrasing, and also leads to a very one-sided view of the subject. I've added two reference to the article with links to their pages on Google books (most of which are visible, at least in the UK). The print copies may also be in the Longy library:
Marco, Tomás (1993). Spanish Music in the Twentieth Century. 
Draayer, Suzanne Rhodes (2009). Art Song Composers of Spain: An Encyclopedia
The previous reference I had added—Romero, Justo (2004). Liner Notes: Joaquín Turina (1882–1949): Piano Music, Vol. 1—is also very useful, especially for discussing his musical style and works chronology. I suggest you use these as your sources for further expansion with the biography on joaquinturina.com] as a back-up only.
 
One thing you could do is separate out the last paragraph (beginning with """"His works include..."""") with its own heading Music and expand the commentary there. For example, he was a very noted composer of art song, which is given short shrift in the article. Much has been written about his approach to incorporating Spanish musical idiom in his work and on his style in general, including its strengths and weaknesses. This is also lacking in the article.
 
Another possibility, is to separate out a section at the beginning of biography to Early years where you discuss his family background and his musical education prior to Paris. The material between that section and Music could be entitled Paris and Madrid and can always be expanded in the future.
 
A third possibility is to expand and rationalize the list of works in the article. The current one has three major problems. First, it excludes many of his important works because it relies solely on those scores available at IMSLP. Secondly, it gives no indication of each work's type. Thirdly, it gives no indication of the date of their composition. Listing them alphabetically, is not a good way to go. If you do decide to concentrate on improving the works list, I suggest using List of compositions by Claude Debussy by genre as a model, although in this case, the list would not be a separate article, but rather continue to appear in the Selected works section of Joaquín Turina.

 First.Regarding the above very respectable commentary by the also very respectable editor , I feel I must affix this preliminary response, as for the upcoming weeks I won't be able to build a properly documented reply. You say that I  'unilaterally and without a source named Guevara as an official """"executioner"""".'  Not true, I did supply a reference  from a reliable source (Behind Che Guevara’s mask, the cold executioner Times Online (from The Sunday Times) September 16, 2007) that I later displaced downward. Yes, I am clearly not interested in the consensus of blatant leftist editors who regard Ernesto """"Che"""" Guevara as their personal hero, or idol, or totem, who believe he should be thought of as an exemplary human being. If user Nubiatech feels offended by the word 'bullshit', I may also feel offended when he/she childishly calls 'POV' my qualification of mass executioner, which by the way is an historical fact, as many sources prove, and which should be familiar terrain to . With all due respect, when he states that """"...none of the scholarly journals, or major biographies refer to Guevara primarily in such a manner"""", one wonders if he has gone through the immense mass of documentation available, for example, from Cuban exiles? The qualification to use should be mass murderer, which Guevara was, instead of the milder executioner. To display respect or deference toward an overt criminal is not only unjustifiable, it is plain hypocrisy.

 Second, the WP:NPOV guideline states:
 """"Balance
 Neutrality weights viewpoints in proportion to their prominence. However, when reputable sources contradict one another and are relatively equal in prominence, the core of the neutral point of view policy is to let competing approaches exist on the same page: work for balance, that is: describe the opposing viewpoints according to reputability of the sources, and give precedence to those sources that have been the most successful in presenting facts in an equally balanced manner."""", etc. 

 Let's briefly examine what the lead section states about """"El Che"""", to see if all viewoints are represented:
  he was an Argentine Marxist revolutionary,  (sounds respectable enough, perhaps chic, even classy)
 (he was a) politician,                       (respectable enough)
 (he was an) author,                          (sounds very respectable)
 (he was a) physician,                        (very respectable indeed)
 (he was a) military theorist,                (respectable enough)
 (he was a) guerrilla leader.                 (respectable for some)
 It should be obvious that there is no balance at all in the above qualifications; they all depict a character that ought to attract admiration, to say the least, hiding the """"insignificant"""" fact that he was a three-hundred-fold manslayer, even calling POV a reference to it. This is the logical consequence of the diligence with which leftist editors quickly delete anything that might mar their hero's image, and even cry foul (like  above) when anyone doesn't abide by their rules. This user even writes """"POV (not a fact) mentioned with due weight elsewhere on the article"""" in his reverting edit summary. Question: if it already is mentioned elsewhere, why there it's not considered 'POV', while within the lead section it is? The marrow of the discussion is that we are not talking of viewpoints here, we are talking about facts.  
 
 Third. I've been following the WP:Ignore all rules rule, mentioned by  in a prominent location in his user page, toward the objective of having Wikipedia tell the truth, which doesn't appear to be among the most important ones in this Encyclopedia (if it is, I'd appreciate anyone's help to tell me about it).

Alright. First to your analysis. Information darwinism is the opposition to pig-headedness. Bring me the right arguments and I will be convinced - as anyone should be. But failing to do so you cannot convince me. You cannot convince me by begging, threats, bullying, bribing and whatever else you can think of. Only the argument is what counts. What's """"right"""" is not defined by the mainstream opinion. If 2000 years ago, people largely figured slavery was the right thing, or that the earth was flat, or that violent computer games turn people into mass murderers, that doesn't make it anyhow right. The truth is not found by a demoscopic process, but instead, by an organic, darwinistic process that Information darwinism tries to understand and act in accordance with.

I do consider your thoughts on the subject flawed on a deeper level. Part of our problem to communicate is certainly because of the limitations of language. When we use words, and you understand certain words to have a different meaning than how I understand them (e.g. """"Force"""") then we can not engage in a proper dialogue without first sorting out the terminology required. So if you do find that I use a word in a different way than how you would use it, or anything else """"weird"""", request from me a definition of the term. This is purely the linguistic barrier that must be overcome.

Now to some items that I seem to have brushed over:

The data suggest rape victims suffer more psychological trauma than other victims of assault. 

What data? By what standards? Someone beaten into a bloody pulp, robbed, or whatever, may well suffer more severe psychological trauma than someone who is victim to """"rape"""" by lax standards. These are problems rooted in terminology. If you want us to waste literally weeks to figure out the truthfulness of the statement """"rape victims are off worse than regular assault victims"""" then I have to say, no thanks. Because as a categorical statement, I can tell you right away - that is false.

You claim to want rape treated simply as assault in one instance and then go and suggest it should be a special form of assault. (which it is)

It is a (special) form of assault. That does not mean it needs to be treated with different standards than other, specicific (! better terminology?) forms of assault. Assault with a gardening rake is also a special form of assault, that doesn't mean it has to be treated fundamentally different from assault with a pitchfork. Again, terminology appears to be the problem.

Having rape as a separate category of crime allows for special systems to be in place for victims and court systems.

This is not something that I have """"brushed over"""". That is what you appear to be in favor of. I disagree strongly. If someone's victim of a criminal offense, he should not be treated """"specially"""" - that is, not like other victims of criminal offenses. Otherwise you are just asking for rape victims being ridiculed by society / police / legal system while non-sexual assault victims get treated fairly. I claim that only if there is no legal difference between sexual assault and non sexual assault, that sexual assault victims (and perpetrators) can be treated fairly as everyone would wish.

Who do you actually propose giving these weapons to?

How exactly is it my job to decide who should get weapons? I would assume, similiar standards to car ownership and gun ownership should be applied. Both cars and guns are extremely dangerous in the wrong hands - lethal weapons you might say - but both serve an useful purpose: Security and Transportation. I do not think that anyone should be denied the right to own a handgun. And I certainly do not credit a state institution with the rights to decide who gets to own one and who doesnt. But what exactly are you asking me for? Elaborate the legislature of my dreams? I don't see sense in asking me that.

Well, there you have it. Basically all of the issues I have """"brushed over"""" in your mind come down to linguistic issues, terminology and the such. The answers are irrelevant as they can never be given without a ludicrous amount of detail given to the questions. I've known this - This is one of the underlying problems that you have - You fail to identify different uses of terminology and resolve them accordingly. But I would suspect that we have even deeper still disagreements on very many things than just the attitude of resolving conflicts of terminology. This is why I suspect your methodology of thinking is deeply flawed - rather than my own. And that is why I tried to tell you """"You first need to get your shit straight"""" before we can argue on actual subjects like rape legislature and social consequences thereof in a productive manner.

 Removal of beta service pages/notability issues 

Hi Henrik

I have edited the entry on my father, Keith Lawrence who flew in the Battle of Britain in 1940.  He is still alive and I see him every week.  As well as knowing his date of birth and his general life history, I have access to his Pilot's Flying Logbook, giving completely accurate information about his time in RAF - but this is not a published document.   This information and the Logbook are primary sources, which I have used for the Edits I have done.

I have noted several administrative points:

(a)  It says """"This is very much a beta service and may disappear or change at any time"""", presumably because of the low numbers of people viewing the page.
(b) """"The topic of this article may not meet the general notability guideline. Please help to establish notability by adding reliable, secondary sources about the topic. If notability cannot be established, the article is likely to be merged, redirected, or deleted. (August 2011)""""

My questions are: 
1) If I add secondary sources (confirmation of material relating to Keith Lawrence which is in various published books) does that reduce the liklihood of the article being merged, redirected or deleted?  Or might it disappear anyway, because it is a 'beta service'?
2) If I spend time adding references and citations to secondary sources, is there a time limit for doing this, please?  (For example, 6 months from the August 2011 date mentioned above?)

Basically, I would like to know, please, if it is worth me spending time providing secondary sources if the article will be deleted anyway because of the low number of 'hits' the page receives.

Thanks,

Speedy deletion of That nigga crackers

 ::: Ah,but you said that you would.I am holding you to your word.If you want to chicken out now it's ok by me.You are claiming there is a consensus about a complex bit of proof which you refuse to reveal.
 ::: And we are not going to pay another one of those Comrade Stalin rules bit.There is no other discussion page on the entire Wickie where a rent a mob plays the games that are played on this subject.
 ::: Yes,I am always honored to have students write to me.I never had a letter from a post-Modernist University before, though I got quite a few from Duke students when the infamous gang of """"88"""" Duke academics(the numbers actually varied from 134 to 40 something)were trying(quite literally) to lynch members of the the Lacrosse team.
That was a real  academic consensus,Paul!Much better than any evidence of a consensus about Pericles!It included(still does) Huston Baker former president of PMLA,and Karla Holloway,who was rewarded for her behavior by a temporary lectureship at Harvard. In fact it included the entire English department with the exception(of course) of the anti-Strat(horrors personal research).
 ::: No, this type of concensus doesn't disturb me or those for whom I write and,I am ever enheartened to find new proof,that such a Marxist view of concensus it isn't intimidating the young.The reasons why William Shakspere is ,in all probability, a fraud are exactly the same type of reasons that Crystal Mangum was raped by thee,five,fifteen or thirty members of the Duke Lacrosse team.Forstarters you can't fit a thosand pounds of flesh(Crystal's minimum figure) into a nineteen forty, two by four,john.
 ::: Nevertheless,the overwhelming concensus of the Duke English faculty,one lone anti-Strat dissenting,is that it did happen.And I see no reason why if the Wickie rules which you invoke are consistently applied,that the Duke Lacrosse Hoax should not be revised accordingly.
 :::Or let's take another example here:Wickie's admirable treatment of the Alger Hiss case,a trial which I have followed, blow by blow, since the 1950's.It states correctly that there is almost a consensus as to Hiss's guilt among the present generation of American historians.(Not I suspect true of British or Eastern bloc historians)
But it, admirably, goes on to list some twenty reasons(with footnotes)demostrating why there are the most serious reasons(some of them physical as in the Duke case) for disbelieving that """"consensus"""".This constitutes a minimum of what both the young aand the old have a right to expect of the Shakespeare discussions.

I don't disagree in principle with anything you've written above. I would have no problem with a much stricter notability policy that favored importance over other concerns. However, what you or I might prefer takes  or should take  a back seat to what is. And what is does not require so stringent a standard, at least the way I read the current notability standards. In my view, David Boothroyd met these standards  though barely so  even before the minor scandal. After it, I think there's no question he does. While I share your concerns regarding the future of such articles, the article as it currently stands in userspace presents no viable BLP concerns as far as I can tell.
On a tangent, I am actually considering reworking the notability standards in a way that addresses your concerns above as my first Wikipedia-space project. There are so many """"nobodies"""" that have articles currently that I think this is a rather necessary change. As this would be a major shift, I don't plan on working on it on the actual page, but using a sandbox of some sort.

Hey Merzul, glad you have a sense of humor too.  There is actually a policy that admins are supposed to follow when a block might be controversial.  Obviosuly the admin in question and I have not seen eye to eye on the talk page of an extreemly controversial subject.  According to that policy he should have mentioned his intent to block me the admin notification board to let the other admins know prior top blocking me.  He did not do that.  He also is obligated to provide me with some specifics which he did not do.  And """"Final warning"""" suggests a previous warning had been given.  I would not be shocked if all my comments here get deleted and he uses WP:Soapbox as an excuse.  Oh well, what are you gonna do.  The only thing that bothers me is I cannot post anything on any of the admin boards to get a question or two answered and I cannot post on NCDave's talk page (he would appreciate the irony here I think).  He also deleted my comments on the talk page yet he leaves dozens of actual viscous attacks done by others there, I attacked no one so this selective enforcement makes me smile too.   I suspect the """"batman"""" comment sent him over the top (I'm Batman).  But we have one guy claiming he's a nuclear scientists and therefore evolution is wrong, another guy (who this Night dude is demonstrably sympathetic too) who claims he's a doctor and has proven evolution to be false, so I figured letting the cat out of the bag and admitting I'm batman was just as relevant (shhh mum's the word, my wife would kill me if she knew I was a crime fighter).  The talk page is obviously not a place for people to claim they can/have proven evolution to be wrong nor is it a good place to appeal to one's own authority.  But, in Nightguy's eyes I guess you can claim you're a nuclear scientist but claiming to be batman somehow violates some policy.

You deleted Image:80 save for web.jpg in October 2006 saying that it was a """"Redundant image of Image:80 save for webx5.jpg"""". It was nothing of the sort - if you'd looked at the discussion it was linked on (or even the heading) you'd have seen it was a comparison of recompression, with Image:80 save for web.jpg being saved once at 80, and Image:80 save for webx5.jpg saved 5 times at 80 quality.

I suppose you're right about """"Bască"""" (though the word """"[Basque]"""" has no connection with Latin, it is more likely a later addition to the Romanian language  I can't imagine a pilleati wearing one p ) and you might be right about """"gîdel"""" also. 

For the other two though, """"adămană"""" and """"dezgauc"""", I heard them used with the indicated meanings (the latter as a verb, as matter of fact). Of course, that doesn't necessary mean that those were the original meanings.

Thanks for your compliments. I don't remember much more about Admiral Makarov than what I wrote in the stub. I agree with the need of consistency in transliteration. I think, however, that when some Russian term is already established in English, the established transliteration should take precedence of the letter by letter rule. My impression (not confirmed though a thorough search though) is that Kniaz iz a more common English usage of the Russian word Князь. However, the google counts for kniaz and knyaz are close enough, so my impression is rather subjective. Also, the article you refered me to gives two choices for transliteration of Великий as both Velikiy"""" or Veliky''. The former term seems better to me, but again this is rather subjective. What do you think? I would be happy to abide with a consensus decision in the future. Regards, Irpen 21:30, Mar 18, 2005 (UTC)""",0,0,0,0,0,0

We presumably disagree as to whether, in the subject instance, Editor """"A"""" knew, or even suspected, the information (the year of death for the author who had just died that week) which Editor """"A"""" added to the article, was in a non-standard format. So then, if that were the case as to Editor """"A"""", I think then that Editor """"B"""" should obtain a consensus before changing (or deleting in its entirety) the information added by Editor """"A"""" in a format that Editor """"B,"""" acting alone without a consensus, believes in good faith to be a non-standard format. I think that except in the very rare case where there can be no reasonable belief that Editor """"A"""" was acting with a good faith belief that he was adding to the article, but rather, he was vandalizing it, should Editor “B” proceed to delete or edit the work of Editor “A” without first obtaining a consensus, or at the very least, to receive a (favorable) response to his request to Editor “A” that there be a change.

I believe that a procedure like this is in compliance with “assuming good faith”, which as you know is a fundamental principle on Wikipedia: It is this assumption that (other) editors' edits and comments are made in good faith. [Wikipedia:Assume good faith] that, I think, is what is missing in the approach taken by Editor “B.” That is, that Editor “B” should have approached the work (the newly added/inserted information) of Editor “A” with the assumption that we are all supposed to be operating under at all times, that Editor “A’s” additions/deletions/revisions/etc. were made in good faith, and that being the assumption, it cannot be appropriate for Editor “B” to single-handedly and without a consensus, delete all (or even part) of Editor’s “A” work. Does that strike you as an outrageous proposition? I mean, presumably Editor “A” and “B” share common flaws of imperfection found in so many humans, and presumably, going into the issue without any knowledge of the other editor, neither editor can presume that he is absolutely correct in every aspect and that anyone who views anything differently than he is a vandal intent on destroying Wikipedia. 

Isn’t it at the outset basically a 50/50 proposition when an editor goes, to delete the newly added information by another editor, that he may be wrong in making that deletion? And if it’s 50/50, shouldn’t he ask for a consensus before deleting the work of another editor, or at a bare minimum contact the other editor and have some reasonable assurance that Editor """"A"""" has received his note/email/posting/etc. before deleting Editor “’A’s” work?

I might comment that in our situation, it was not an instance of Editor “A” changing something that was already on the page and then Editor “B,” seeing what was obviously an act of vandalism in the changes by editor “A,” reverting those changes. Not at all. Editor “A” added new information (the year of death for an author who had just died), and Editor “B,” believing that it was presented in a non-standard format to have this information at that particular place, deleted it. Editor “B” believed that this date information belonged, if anywhere, only on a page devoted to the author himself, and nowhere on a page the subject of which was the author’s work, in this instance, a book.

I do in fact disagree with Editor “B” on that point. I find it very useful to see when, during an author’s lifetime, and also in relation to significant world events, an author or artist wrote or published or created a particular piece of work, Articles about the book, or other work, when discussing the writing and publishing, virtually always includes references to when he wrote the book or when he had it published and even references to when other drafts of the book were created (like Herman Melville losing the first finalized version of Moby Dick at sea and having to re-write the entire book years later, or other such interesting facts, like authors commenting that they would have changed many things in a book if they had written it after a particular event in their lives personal to them (e.g., the death of a beloved father, birth of their own child, marriage, good or bad fortunes, etc.) or events in their lives in which we collectively share in some part (the 9/11 attacks, sinking of the Titanic, WWII, War in Vietnam, the shooting of Ronald Regan/Kennedy/Kennedy/King/VJ day, VE day/man walking on the moon/the falling of the Berlin Wall, or the deaths of Roosevelt’s, Churchhill, Elvis, John Lenon,",0,0,0,0,0,0

You would think that academic journals have taken over Wikipedia. The idea that I have actually improved the article with my additions, and that others can improve it further, has completely escaped much of the Wikipedia culture these days. Wikipedia has simply forgotten the idea that this is collaboratively edited, rather than having a coterie of people who simply reject all edits if they do not thread the eye of the needle through the dozens of acronym style guides. You guys are disgusting, really. You are standing on the shoulders of millions of edits and now you reject the very thing that got you to where you are, namely lots of collaboratively edited small improvements. Now any change has to go through hurdles that would never have created Wikipedia in the first place.

Hi, let me ask a question. Since I am a little busy and 
I am not English langauge native, my ssentences could be poor.
And I would be glad if you answer my question immediately since I have to leave
a little later. 

When I edited a page, I usually did line break after about 60 or so characters.
You could see how I edit by editing your talk page, this page. As you know,
by the tag < p > of the HTML langauge, the wiki did aggregate the line-broken
sentences into a full paragraph automatically.

I thought that diff is the main block of the storage mechanism of wiki, as
wiki does not have to save all the full page. Wiki needed to save only
diff of the pages. I think so.

Then by making line break as I am doing now, does my method make
the diff data of wiki SMALL? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Diff said that
Some editors find that adding manual line breaks improves the diff function.
In other words, is making many line breaks of a paragraph is more efficient
to reduce the database size of wiki? Thanks. (  )",0,0,0,0,0,0

Typically, when Xenophrenic sees a valid edit (by wiki policy) that he disapproves of (for whatever reason), he seeks to get others to remove it. This strategy is quite effective as he says the edit needs balance, or needs the proper context, or isn't the full story, etc. There are many different reasons used, but the end result is him adding so much trivial nonsense ( > 2 to 1 ratio in his POV) that average editors cringe when they see it. Xenophrenic then declares that the original unbalanced POV version can ONLY stay if his even more unbalanced additions are there to provide proper context. This leads to edit warring over days and even weeks, articles often get locked down. Some reasonable and responsible editors step in and remove it all in the name of peace and to move forward in improving the article. Xenophrenic gets what he wanted all along, and boosts his edit count with the disruptive edit warring. Some call this tactic a form of wiki-terrorism, I say it shows that Xenophrenic is quite calculated and intelligent, even though he is mostly obtuse during discussions. Talk

I looked through several bios on bookrag and none, some of which were pretty lengthy, mentioned Falk. It's off topic and additionally, he doesn't even have an article.  

Well, I'm not sure that Falk needs to be included in the Jordan article or not (though he did seem to have a huge influence on Jordan's career), but in any case, I have written a Wikipedia article for David Falk.  I would appreciate it if others would read it over to see if the article is any good, and secondly to decide if he should be mentioned in the Jordan article (as I look at the Jordan article again, it even says in the second sentence that """"he became one of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation""""... since it was Falk who did the marketing, he probably deserves a link there).  My information for the Falk article came partly from David Halberstan's book Playing for Keeps: Michael Jordan and the World He Made, which has about 10 pages on Falk, as well as a ton of online articles I found.  Cheers!   

I added a few brief lines about Falk in the section """"Media figure and business interests.""""  Falk is probably too off-topic to put him in the opening section, but I think he's important enough to mention in a section specifically about Jordan's role as a media figure, since Falk was largely responsible for crafting Jordan's image.  

 Divorce 

Is is just me or does it seem like, unlike an earlier divorce threat five years ago, Michael & Juanita's split seemed to have been kept quiet by most of the media?

I'm wondering because the first I've heard of the current proceedings was last night when I heard something about this being the most expensive celebrity divorce ever?   
Five years ago, he was still in the NBA, so obviously he has a bigger spot light on him. For the most part, Jordan isn't under the lime light anymore, so it doesn't have much coverage.  
It was announced in the press when it happened. But it was one of those things where people stopped talking about it a couple of days later.

Jordan has had plenty of nicknames, but we don't list every single Nickname, only the most identifiable. That's why his NBA.com Historical Bio, only lists Air Jordan as his nickname. I propose mutual consensus on the issue, before more users begin to add obsessive Wp:fancruft to the article. Feel free to comment.

The point is that all versions is obviously that Jerusalem would have evil caused by God to BEGIN with with, before the other nations.

Creating a fuller """"Responses"""" section would be nice, but isn't a priority for me.

I agree with your assessment that """"it's hard to learn"""" is the biggest issue with NVC.  There's also no standardized curriculum for it, and the way it's taught is constantly evolving. 

When it comes to criticism, I wish there could be some distinction between criticizing the core ideas of NVC and criticizing Rosenberg's presentation of it. Though I suppose that's a hard distinction for outsiders to make. There are a few things that Rosenberg says that I don't agree with, or ways he says things that are exaggerated, perhaps to try to shock people into seeing things differently in a teaching context  but none of those are the core of NVC, and other trainers including myself present NVC in ways that don't include those elements that are easy to take exception to, yet which still capture all the core ideas.

90e0a235104be6e1,"Invitation to workshops on Wikipedia editing
Dear Ploversegg,

We are a team of researchers at the University of Oxford and AU Sharjah, researching the experiences of editors of content about the Arab world on Wikipedia. We are interested in your experiences of editing Wikipedia and are organising two events that we think you would be an excellent contributor to.

First, starting next week on Monday 27th August, we are hosting an online discussion about what it is like to contribute to Wikipedia in Arabic and to articles about the Middle East and North Africa. We are interested in what barriers you perceive to exist in Wikipedia, how articles can be made better and generally what can be done to expand and improve Arabic Wikipedia. This discussion will take place on a MediaWiki hosted at our institution and be available in English and Arabic. We will allow users to create their own discussion pages in addition to our discussions.

Second, we are hosting face-to-face workshops in Cairo from 21st-22nd October 2012. If you are interested in this we may be able to pay your travel and accommodation costs depending on where you live. This workshop will cover similar themes to the online discussion but will allow participants to meet one another and benefit from being together.  

We will take care of the organization and planning and all you have to do is show up and be ready to discuss. But if you would like to help shape some of the discussion themes in advance, please let us know. We have booked time in the workshops for Wikipedian-led discussions.  

More details can be found in our “Frequently Asked Questions” section below. 

We would be delighted to welcome you to either (or both) event. Please let me know (wikiproject@oii.ox.ac.uk) if you would like to participate and we can send you more details.

Sincerely,

Mark, Bernie, Ilhem, Ali, Ahmed and Heather

Frequently Asked Questions:
 
What is the purpose of this project?

This project is about who represents the Arab World on Wikipedia, and how the Middle East and the Arab world is represented on Wikipedia. We are studying Wikipedia through statistics, edit  history data and personal experiences. Our ultimate goal is to help Wikipedia grow in size and fairness and do academic research on this topic. You can read more about the project here: http://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/research/projects/?id=70 From this page, you can also find a biography of the researchers. You may also want to see our interactive visualizations about Wikipedia here: http://wikiproject.oii.ox.ac.uk/ 

Who is funding this project?

This project is funded by the International Development Research Centre (http://www.idrc.ca). This organization is funded by the Canadian government to improve infrastructure across the world, including online content. We have been working with the IDRC since June 2010. 

Why did you contact me?

Because you’re awesome. In all seriousness, we have been looking through Wikipedia for active editors based on user activity in either Arabic Wikipedia or articles about the Arab world. We have not contacted everyone we could, but we contact people that we think will help to balance the discussion and help us (and each other) learn more about the state of Wikipedia.  

Do I need to participate in both events?

Not at all. You are welcome to participate in both or just one. We recognise that it will be more convenient for some people to have online conversations and for others to speak in person. For some people it will not be practical to fly to the Middle East, but we still consider their contributions important and want to give them a voice in this work.

Can I use my Wikipedia handle in the online discussion?

You do not need to use any particular name on the online forum. All we need is a valid email address so you can register. You can post using your real name, your Wikipedia name or a completely different nickname, whatever allows you to speak your mind most effectively. 

What sort of travel funding will you supply for the face-to-face workshop?

We have funding for travel and accommodation costs for approximately twenty participants depending on where they are coming from. If you would like to join us in one of the face-to-face meetings then we wi",0,0,0,0,0,0

Bill Bzuk, with all due respect, has  a """"pre determined position"""" in his books on the Avro Arrow.

Unless the article writer tells the truth about the cancellation, & removes the silly sections ( replicas, conspiracies, etc.etc.) the rewrite will simply be """"inmates running the asylum again"""".

Eisenhower and McCarthy
Below is some proposed language for the Ike/McCarthy subhead; I've placed it here because it contains a lot of """"perhaps'es"""", but hopefully it's illumintating.
President Dwight D. Eisenhower due to his past close association with General Omar Bradley may have been apprised of the existence of the Venona project, the secret program within the U.S. Army Signals Intelligence Service decrypting KGB messages originating in the United States.  Eisenhower's former chief of intelligence and the first head of the CIA, General Walter Beedle Smith may have been brought in on the secret too, and the CIA began recieving some decrypted information in 1953.  There is no indication Eisenhower's Attorney General Herbert Brownell, Jr. was made aware of the highly secret information.

 My WP Experience 

Thank you for welcoming me, Materialscientist. After some time here I can tell you that I really admire WP as a joint effort by many to create something constructive. The several weeks I have been here has been an interesting experience. I learned a lot, wandering around the Random articles. I also tried to contribute on issues that I know well. I had my share of learning other people's academic formation and their inner world (psychologies)i.e. how they react to the unknown or suppressed. As a social scientist, I was surprised to see the magnified importance of the behaviour and perception factors. I think I should learn more on social psychology and related behavioural disciplines to apply in my work. To cut a long story short, I think I have been doing my humble contribution to the WP but believe could have done more in this rather short period, should I not faced reactionary attitudes, especially on """"national"""" issues. It is really astonishing to see how people react to editing events that have occurred before our grandfathers were born, if they suspect their world of conceived reality is threatened. Never mind if these words look confusing to you, because they also are for me. I know I simply received a -perhaps automated- welcome message from you and am not expecting an answer to these lines. Indeed I am writing more as a factor of self inspection and will certainly erase these lines after a short while. All the best.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

You had mentioned that it would be a big improvement, and so I was wondering if this would change your support regarding deletion. Even if it is not perfect right now, there is a need for something other than AfDs to handle these articles, and this is a process that will only continue to improve.

 I believe in their Indoaryan Origin (or Iranians of India). 

Certainly from what ive seen, read and experienced about Roma people i think that they certainly show close resemalance to similar Nomads of Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and  just North India (not south India); yet i don´t agree that the historians or anthropologist should keep on mentioning India as the origin of their people, since India is to big a concept and ethnicity to do so. We must first encounter that really India as a concept is borrowing or a creation of the invading Aryans (indoeuropeans of iranian orign) that actually settled up north in between Pakistan and Afghanistan as the origin of this culture (later tu establish themselves in Rajasthan, Jammu-Kashmir, Guajarat and north-west regions basically to extend their culture)

It is precisly the regions of the """"Sindhu River"""" between mountains of Afghanistan and the Pakistnian valleys of """"Kashmir"""" and """"Punjab"""" the real home of Hinduism and """"indoaryans"""" (indoiranians).

So what i mean, is that if we talk about """"gypsy"""" people we must talk not precisaly about India but first about Pakistani or Afghan-Iranian aryan culture and tribes that entered those regions invading the aboriginal populations and established a new culture.

That is why many people feel (i am one) that """"roma"""" people have more connections to mesapotamia or semitic peoples since many forget to mention that indoarians (invading iranians) where culturally and ethnically closer to Semites, Huns and Greeks that came from Iran (a fusion between them peoples id say). 

Precisly the Romani languague closely resembles Punjabi and Hindi yet more closer even to Pothohari and mountain languages of Pakistan and Afghanistan (were there are many nomadic tribes).

That is the reason why many gypsy dont look Indian (south indian atleast) but more Persian, Iranian, Kurdish, Dardic, Drokpas or Pashtu people and dont have dravidian traits of austrolid or asian origin; but certinaly resemble a mix of southern european mediteraneas (iranian-greek) mixed with semitic traits. M

Many gyspys have long beards as how old nomadic VEDIC ARYANS (sun worshipers, budda etc) had; as well as have green eyes and a reddish tone to their skin like people for centuries where nomads in the mountain areas of Pakistan, North India and Afghanistan. What i mean to say is that they dress,look,act,and their music is more similar to people like the Kurds,Dards,Guajars,Pashtus,Pothoharis,Kashmiris and Punjabis than to dravidian-mongolian or austrolid indians.

We must also remember that the apperance of those nomadic indoeuropean (iranian) and others partly semitic-iranian-hun-greekish people; is how old ARYANS used to look like; add to that a reddish tone of skin since they lived in the mountains. 

The dress of gypsy people closely resembles more Iranin or Afghan nomadi peoples. The tipical jewlery and earings of women nomads in those areas is one sign. Also the long hair used buy man plus earings close resembles those aryan conceptos of sunworshipping worriors that where great horse riders and metalsmiths who brought Cattle_Cows to the desert and tropical areas of Pakistan and India; that was how historically dravidians described those whiter skinned, mostage-bearded men that invaded their more asian-austroloid land.

I believe Gypsys or Roma are descendants of the """"Indoaryan"""" of  orgin worriors of """"iranian origin"""" that settled in the mountanous regions of Pakistan (Pothohari-Kashmir) and those who went into the deserts of Rajasthan (Rajputs-Jatts). I believe these people gatthered together to defend themselves from invading Muslims as did classical persiands; yet where defeated and pride got to them so they fled their land since they wanted to continue their concept of nomadic sunworshippers.

Gypsyes do not resemble dravidian culturs but more Irani (Persian)Afghani(Pashtu)-Punjabi-Kashmiri-Rajasthani-Harayana-Brhamman cultures of indoeuropean or irani-scythian-greekish influence and language...

Gypsy Music is not only resembled in the famous ZARDS, the primitive Tangos or Boleros of Romania, Hungary and Russia; and Flamenco or Cante Jondo but u can trace their indoaryan music in Country,Rock and Roll-Hippie Music, Fox Trot-Jazz; and ofcourse latin american rythms like: Rumba, Salsa, Bolero, Tango, Peruvian Valse, Tondero, Zamacueca, Charchalera, Milonga etc...

That's another performance shock for me: one article bypasses cache. I cleared my entire browser cache, and then Assange showed the cache-page copy. As for broad resistance, the Continuous Improvement movement (Kaizen, etc.) has warned, """"People dislike change"""".

I advised Jimbo, to add """"More pillars"""" where Performance becomes a major priority, like Civility or NPOV, rather than """"personal preference to see results"""" in the same hour, while they demand the cite-tools still work. You might know I've had severe rejections trying to defuse essay wp:PERF, and explain how the Titanic sank because """"Don't worry"""" thwarted other people from acting or improving (the ship design included ample lifeboats rejected by others). This year, with the Costa Concordia in Italy, passengers worried enough about the tilting ship to call land-based police to complain the ship seemed damaged while crew pretended """"Don't worry"""". Enough. I think we are reaching """"critical mass"""" to move forward here. The next compromise consensus supports all parameters (as demanded pronto), and auto-runs the quick citations, with later promises to """"fix"""" {Citation/core} where possible, and still support those cite-tools which generate {cite_web} calls and such. It is a hideously complex upgrade, with over 23 forks as {cite_book}, {cite_video}, {cite_document}, {cite_press_release}, {cite_encyclopedia}, even """"{citeweb}"""" or """"{cite web}"""" but fixing the most-used will cure the speed problems. Plus, the talk-page already warns to deprecate """"surname1"""" for """"last1"""" where 3 fewer alias parameters could mean 2x faster for that parameter, perhaps next year. Beyond the complex fast {Fcite} templates, the rapid {cite_quick} runs 10x-12x faster, so """"Assange"""" can drop from 18 to 5-second edit-preview. I already saved some temporary revisions to """"prove"""" Assange can reformat in 5 seconds:

Most of the last edit seems to belong to the talk page rather than in the article, so I have moved it so I can be discussed.

Broader context
Use of the term """"psychoanalytic theory"""" implies that there is a core theory which is complete by itself.  This view is not common even among practicing analysts, who in large part recognise that the mind is a function of the brain, so that any full theory of the psyche needs to refer to the brain.  An excellent review of this is Kandel ER (1999) """"Biology and the future of psychoanalysis"""", Am.J.Psychiat 156:505.

Psychoanalytic thinking is inseparably bound also to clinical treatment of patients.  Some purists claim that achieving insight is the only goal of psychoanalysis; but health insurers generally require more concrete goals such as reduced mental illness or increased time at work.  Both of these clinical perspectives assume that the effect on actual patients is important  so they should be included in this article.  An excellent review of the clinical benefits of psychoanalysis is Fonagy, Roth & Higgitt (2005), Bull.Menninger Clinic 69(1):1-58.

This article would not be complete without consideration of substantial attacks on psychoanalysis and its theory, which have reshaped psychiatric practice in the UK and USA over the past 20-30 years.  These attacks can be classified as empirical (Gabbard, Gunderson & Fonagy 2002); financial (Detre & McDonald 1997); theoretical (Meehl 1998 calculates that there are many psychoanalytical explanations possible for any single clinical problem); and circumstantial (e.g. past failures with respect to homosexuality and childhood abuse, and the antipathy of many analysts to quantitative research:  Gabbard, Gunderson & Fonagy 2002).

Psychoanalytic theorists may have over-reached themselves in attempting to account for all troublesome psychic phenomena.  However, their concerted efforts to address more circumscribed areas have produced widely acknowledged, influential advances in the areas of defense mechanisms, attachment, the unconscious, transference and counter-transference, and the treatment of borderline personalities, among others.  Each of these advances has been accompanied by individual theories.

Suggestions for the peer-review
The article should not require a paragraph to describe what it is about; instead, its scope should simply be theories to do with psychoanalysis.  It should include subsections on the question of whether (and how) psychoanalysis can be studied objectively, whether it is disproveable in whole or part (and whether this matters), the informal """"theory"""" of the manners in which analysis can be conducted (e.g. bare room unlike Freud; methods of interpretation), and the relationships with behavioural, cognitive, and psychiatric theories.  It would be useful to have an explanation of why psychoanalysis has resisted decline so much more successfully in France than in anglophone countries.  Rather than complicated sentences with complicated words, we should be treated to simple descriptions of the differences between Freudian, Jungian, and Adlerian thinking.  Possibly in lists if that helps to simplify the sentences.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Dramatic oversectioning 

It's not exactly vandalism, but the """"micro-timeline"""" style you are trying to rewrite/revert the Cynthia McKinney article in is entirely inappropriate for WP biographies.  Please take a look at any bio for another congressperson (or in general, activist, politician, etc).  This sort of strictly date-oriented sectioning down to the sentence or short paragraph is simply not done; and it's not done with the very good reason that it reads extremely poorly.  In a more reasonable sized section (several paragraphs, at least), the prose describes the dates associated with the events/actions being described.

Actually, ther's quite a bit of purple prose (and partial sentences, awkward wordings, outright repetitions, etc) in the main text remaining... but reverting my efforts to clean it up is in extremely rude form.

Currently there is no information about some aspects of BHRT treatment on the page, such as the use of testosterone, DHEA, and who knows what else as part of the compounded products. Also, no mention of biest and triest, the original compounds. This article should first be """"encyclopedic"""", and as such needs to explain what the treatment is. As the page currently is, there is little indication  for the reader to know what is being criticized, except for the fragmented claims for BHRT which are strewn throughout the article.

The infamous block

Veritas: do not get Wikinoid yet. The policy is on my side: it was a totally unjust block and I am appealing. I still trust Wikipedia. I don't trust so much certain wikipedians and administrators but I have faith that in the end truth, justice and NPOV shall prevail. If not in the ANI, where admins seem to behave like a wolfpack, at least in first instance, in ArbCom. Policy is very clear and Shell Kinney simply broke all rules. 

In my appeal I also ask for Shell to be recused from further cases against me or related to the controversial article due to bias and misuse of admin privileges. 

I won't go back to that article at least in a looooong while. I've reached my personal limit with it and after all non-existent races are not my primary interest. I believe though that all this conflict will help to raise awareness about what is going on in that battlefield... (oops! article) and specially about Thulean's wikilawyerist attitude. Besides it may also raise awareness about misuse of policy by certain admins that never admit any error nor fulfill their duties. 

Ironically Shell Kinney is running for ArbCom herself. Guess that her campaign is something like """"Wikipedia needs an iron man and that's me"""" of Thatcher. I don't know. I'm voting a more promising candidate.

The Ottoman census reflects only the religuious adherence of the population and nothing else

Exactly. So what makes you think that using religion as the primary criterion of nationality is not the closest thing to the truth? Maybe it is, and maybe it isn't, but neither you nor me are in position to decide that. This is why in my version all criteria used in the demographies are explained in detail, without deciding which is right and which is wrong, and that my friend is what we call neutrality. You might as well try and take a hint. Nothing from the Turkish cencus proves nor implies that those Greeks were not Greek speaking. The majority of Bulgarian population had never been adherent to the Patriarch of Constantinople. You're confusing yourself with the small Bulgarian or Slavic-speaking population which viewed itself as part of the Roman nation which had lost its mother tongue over time. Therefore despite religion and language, the greater part of the population of Southern Macedonia viewed itself as Greek (or Roman if you prefer). Then if we can't trust any demography, think of the population exchanges. 50,000 Greeks entered Greek Macedonia from Pirin Macedonia, and some 60,000 Bulgarians left for Bulgaria. Then some 500,000 Greeks enter from Turkey and suddenly, we have some 1 million Greeks in Greek Macedonia? Where did the other half million come from? Mars? Oh, I know, it's a Bulgarian """"majority"""" group that the Greek government is still hiding isn't that so? And now think of the ludicrous numbers that you're trying to pass as the truth: 2 million Bulgars in the entire of Macedonia and the assumption of another million in the south. I mean, use your brain for ones and do the maths - have you ever checked what the population of Bulgaria is today? Honestly some people just can't take the truth. And if neither of that convinces you then think of the Greco-Serbian alliance. Would the Serbs have ever agreed with Greece occupying over half of Macedonia for itself unless that land was not primarily Greek? Serbia was significantly stronger than Greece and in the search of Slavic-speaking lands to assimilate. It would have never happened. If you really want to do something to help your country, I would advise you to go over there and offer your people some physical help. I don't think that making nationalist propaganda of the internet is one of their priorities at the moment.

 From Jimbo Wales, paraphrased from this post from September 2003 on the mailing list:
 If a viewpoint is in the majority, then it should be easy to substantiate it with reference to commonly accepted reference texts;
 If a viewpoint is held by a significant minority, then it should be easy to name prominent adherents;
 If a viewpoint is held by an extremely small (or vastly limited) minority, it does not belong in Wikipedia regardless of whether it is true or not and regardless of whether you can prove it or not, except perhaps in some ancillary article.

Keep in mind that in determining proper weight we consider a viewpoint's prevalence in reliable sources, not its prevalence among Wikipedia editors.

 Dear Val, who is also a mormon [or a parrots, 'ain't sure]

I found very strange that each time I am answering to one wikipedian/mormons question, it is another who react to it instead of the one to whom it is adress to. 
I do not see why you are defending stand point who are not at all being made by you, nor why you feel the urge to respond for another one than you. 
I think that the person concern, Storm Rider, is grown up enough to do so on its own. 
Unless next time I am under attack, you take the relay and answer that one for me as well. It could be interesting. 
If you have something to say, say it so, but use your own words idea and language instead of making a copy paste of my entire edit, as you have nothing at all to add to it and in fact seems clearly to don't know what to say. 
So do the wisest, just shut up! 
It is in fact evident that you do not have understood one word of what has been sayed, and as you can see, repeating it indefinitely like rot speach, is not going to give you the ability to understand. 
All you do is agressing agressing personal attacks and agressing. 
Try to use half as much of your energy to understand what this is about and I am sure that you might see some light. 
I do not think that my statements can be make clearer than they already are and that your reaction, more than a physical unhability to comprehend, expose your reticence at accepting things you just dont want to accept. 
You cannot accuse me of talking in circle when you are the one doing so as it can be very clearly seen in your edit. 
As for you stupid accusation of me not being >sophie, what about you? Are you VAL? or are you rama? or are you DGL626, there is a lot of nick name on wiki, and all of them cover up a real name. 
They are all a pseudonym, meaning they are anonymous. 
So if I take the name """"anonymous"""" as a pseudo, I will be as hiding and as showing as you are, because at the end, in both case it is a pseudonym with nothing to do with the person real name and identity.

So what are you trying to proove, except the fact that you were unable to figure what I just told you on your own? 
I had a name, this name seems now to be unavailable, and I dont feel to make it again or take another. 
Following wiki rules all are equal on wiki, old rats as well as newbees (hahaha) and even arb com and board members and admi are as equal as usual wikipedian, thought they have much more power than them and abuse of this power constantly without bad conscience, and have learn to twist and bend all wiki rules behond recognition, so who are you trying to fool with your wiki neutrality and wiki equality, who is wikis first rule? 
It is all a lie. 
How can you claim equality with another if you have more power than this other and power on this person and can exclude this person from the group? 
It isnt equality it is power struggle. 
It is adversity, and supremacy and group pressure as here. 
WIKI is oppression and extinction of the freedom of expression, it is so corrupt that not one admi found it disturbing nor strange to banish or revert a user edit to impose his own point of view, on the sacro sankt name of wikis neutrality and equality!

HA HA! 
Make me laught, but dont think you can trick me at believing such lies. 
Please, in the future, avoid using words that you do not fully understand, as """"logic"""". 
For your knowledge english is one of the easiest language to learn so stop affirming stuff like that gratuitiously, do some research first.

5 of them fluently, the others as pocket use. Like german I can read a book but I dont have spoken it for some years so it might take me 2 3 weeks to get back the rythm. 
As a nativ american your knowledge of foreign languages is zero, maybe hightened if you are a mormon who have been on mission outside the US, but you have absolutely no experience of the process of learning new languages. In europe from age 11 we choose between 3 languages: english german and spanish, at age 13, we have to chose another one, and choose between english german, spanish italian russian, from age 15, when we begin graduate school, we have to take another one, and chose between those named before and also chineese and modern american, and a dialect or local language, and can also take hebrew. 
2 to 3 languages are part of the compulsory pensum. 
I also took extra english dialect as the one spoken by semi natives in australia, and english dialect spoken in India.

Oops, my bad.  Here's the explanation.  When I do a restoration I always upload an unrestored version for documentation purposes.  Normally I upload that to Commons, although with this particular image I accidentally uploaded the unrestored version locally.

First, I'm not aware of a book dedicated on the topic of 1988 uprising or even the late 1980s up to the 1990 election. A meaningful book on the topic should in part contain information based on interviews with those involved from all sides, not just based on the account of the exiles. Given that the political climate has just recently improved, I'm sure such a meaningful book is yet to be written. Now, I still think that the military will not fare well even in a more balanced light. (No excuse for killing your own people, and shutting down the education system for a decade. Talk about a lost generation. Talk about cutting the nose to spite the face!)

Second, yes, I've heard some in the military wanted a Golkar-style arrangement (i.e. institutionalized role of the military in parliament/politics) but I'm not aware of a formal public proposal. I'm not sure if that proposal ever had the support of the top brass of the military. Then again, I can also see DASSK rejecting such an offer in the 1990s. As much as I admire her personal courage and integrity, I always thought she should have been more flexible. She was never a natural politician like her father who was a pragmatic person and actually got things done. Not sure which National Assembly you mean. AFAIK, the military did an about face after the 1990 elections that the elections were not to convene the assembly but to write a new constitution. HTH.",0,0,0,0,0,0

I've noticed that the various links have been removed now. I would agree that if a balance cannot be established, there should be no links to any external sites.

The anti-popper folks have theirs  which are alarmest, much like the """"Reefer Madness"""" efforts, of which you posted one or two ealier this week, and the other side has their's, of which I posted a couple this past week. I wish I could find better sites to post, but those two are the only ones I've been able to locate. I did not mean to post a commercial site, and did not think I was posting a commercial site, since none of the sites I posted actually sold any poppers. In rereading your posts, heah, I noted that you thought the sites were commercials for poppers. I would agree that some might consider the second one as such, but the allaboutpoppers.com site is not. If you actually read it, which takes a while due to the huge amount of content, you'll find it's not commercial. It's a research-based site, which gives us lots of valuable information about the history, sociology, and other aspects of the nitrite issue.

 Dumb question? 

Would the repeal of withholding, via Constitutional amendment, apply only to Fed income taxes?  That is to say, would the States be bound to repeal withholding as well, since they are the ones necessarily ratifying it in the first place?

I may have missed it inside the article (which is very good indeed) and if I did I apologize, but it seems to me that once the repeal of withholding becomes an established fact, a great deal of political power passes from the politicians back to the consumer.  Simply put, a dollar represents a unit of freedom.  And if the phrase """"a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush"""" has any truth to it at all, it means political power is being leveraged, indeed heavily back to the consumer/producer for every dollar he keeps.

...from the Mother Jones article, describing your action as removing """"biased POV edits."""" Although i'm not familiar with the book, the reference to Mother Jones as """"The Most Dangerous Woman in America"""" was a common one. I believe that her supporters were not offended by such a description; they were working people who felt abused by the economic system, and they relished such a claim. This is not to say that your edit was improper; i'd have to read the book to know more. But if your edit resulted from use of this phrase, and for no other reason, then it was (in my view) mistaken about the general perception of that description.

 Matt Sanchez 

A request for consensus about what to do about some changes you recently reverted has been posted at Talk:Matt Sanchez.  Thanks,  

 Oldest people 

Hi, I see you've reverted my changes with the comment """"current format has better visual appeal; Wikipedia is not paper"""". I'm trying to understand but all I can make of this is a statement of personal taste, and I'm not convinced. Can we try to compare arguments? To me there are two disadvantages to the old format: 1. it contains duplicate information (the """"To"""" column, saying when someone lost the status of oldest person, is always — necessarily so — equal to the person's day of death); 2. it actually is less appealing to me because the information fills more space and there are many line breaks. It looks more tidy in my version. I'm therefore rather surprised at your change. Thanks for a reply. –  

Please note that if we did the table in 'real-time' and not reconstructed history, we would have people like Charlotte Benkner lose the title when someone older was found, not when they died. Thus, it could technically be different.

Second, I realize it is not absolutely necessary; however, I do think a little redundancy is OK. Visually, if the cases are too close together, then their time with the title looks insignificant. {yakłtalk} 

Did you have to create my user page just in order to respond? (My talk page did exist.) I was going to create it eventually, but in my own tome. How do I get it deleted again now (not just empty but deleted)? Such thoughtlessness really makes me angry. I've copied your comment here and I'm asking you to continue the debate on this page.

I was aware of the theoretical argument you made. You say yourself that it doesn't apply as you it is a retroactive version. Your visual argument I think I understand. Are you saying that with your version each table entry is a two-liner whereas in mine some entries take up one line and some two? –  

PS: I've since found out how to request my user page to be deleted, so I'm no longer looking for guidance on that. –  

Ah, it's worked already. –

So I do not believe anyone any more will buy your misusing of Wikipedia regulations. There is no reversals here, not even technically speaking; because what is going on is mine (article author’s) cleaning of all the shit you keep spraying around.

You are just a trouble maker around here and everyone sees you as such. Now stuff your imaginative misinterpretations of WP regulations to where they belong.  No 3RR violation on my part. But I know why you just threatened with reporting me: it is because I already mentioned to you today that you are in violation of 3RR yourself.

Looking through the archives here, it seems that discussion of the article's name has almost entirely revolved around a suggested move to """"British India"""".  Clearly such a move would be outright wrong.  But that still leaves us with the problem that while """"British Raj"""" does seem to get usage as a name for the territories under the authority of the Governor-General in Council, it's also used as the name for a period (see the article lede at """"History of the British Raj"""" by way of example).  In other words, the term is ambiguous, and thus we keep having people here and elsewhere changing terms back and forth, and I don't see how that will change so long as that ambiguity remains.  That's why I think """"Indian Empire"""" is better; it's clearly about a country.  Alternatively, and I say this through slightly gritted teeth, we could have it at """"British Indian Empire"""".

As for usage by historians, surely they most commonly use the simple term """"India""""?  Which is not of course to say that other terms don't get used (especially in book titles).

Thanks for experimenting with Wikipedia. Your test worked, and has been reverted. Please use the sandbox for any other tests you want to do. Take a look at the welcome page if you would like to learn more about contributing to our encyclopedia. Thanks. - Lucky 6.9 

It's difficult to tell whether you are being sarcastic or are mistaken. What experiment? I cannot find any edits or original articles of mine that you have reverted.

Regards,
 

It's a shame you felt it necessary to revert as """"experimentation"""" what was obviously an article (albeit a stub). As you will see from my history, I am new to Wikipedia but have enjoyed creating and editing a number of articles about some fairly hefty topics. It occurred to me that someone who enjoys wikipedia (such as myself) ought to be referred to as a wikipedophile. A google search reveals no fewer than 132 instances of the word on the net. If other neologisms such as """"leet"""" are to have articles, why not this one? Why not at least leave the article there for others to discuss rather than annihilating it unilaterally?

 

So, you deleted my article because you decided not enough people would be interested in it? That's as good an argument for keeping the article: nobody interested, nobody sees it; someone interested, someone finds it. No harm done. QED. Ah, but in that case, no self-aggrandising administrator satisfaction, and no opportunity to post supercilious mesages about the sandbox. It is easier to destroy than to create. Enjoy.  

OK, I will leave the subject - it is hardly a fair argument when one of us has the power to silence the other on a whim - but as an admin you will perhaps wish to know that you have discouraged me from contributing further to Wikipedia. My brief edit history will show me a valuable contributor, and I had been inspired by the """"be bold in editing"""" tenet of Wikipedia. Alas, this spirit is evidently mired in the usual unaccountable, pseudopolitical hierarchies, fiefdoms and cliques that invariably beleaguer such online efforts. Adieu.

4th paragraph
The 4th paragraph is wrong. 

The black body temperature of the Earth is 5.5 °C.[4] Since the Earth reflects about 28% of incoming sunlight[5], in the absence of the greenhouse effect the planet's mean temperature would be far lower - about -18 or -19 °C [6][7] instead of the much higher current mean temperature, about 14 °C.

The black body temperature of the Earth is -18 or -19 °C, not 5.5 °C (which is the temperature of an ideal blackbody the same distance from the Sun as the Earth). It was correct before it was changed on Dec 9,2009. Also, reference [4] does not support that statement. I suggest the following as a possible replacement paragraph and even as a possible first paragraph since it actually defines what Greenhouse Effect really refers to.

If an ideal thermally conductive blackbody was the same distance from the Sun as the Earth, it would have an expected blackbody temperature of 5.3 °C. However, since the Earth reflects about 30%NASA Earth Fact Sheet (or 28%Introduction to Atmospheric Chemistry, by Daniel J. Jacob, Princeton University Press, 1999. Chapter 7, """"The Greenhouse Effect"""".) of the incoming sunlight, the planet's actual blackbody temperature is about -18 or -19 °C Solar Radiation and the Earth's Energy BalanceIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report. Chapter 1: Historical overview of climate change science page 97, about 33°C below the actual surface temperature of about 14 °C or 15 °C.The elusive """"absolute surface air temperature,"""" see GISS discussion The mechanism that produces this difference between the actual temperature and the blackbody temperature is due to the atmosphere and is known as the Greenhouse Effect.

Note that I also modified the expected temperature and albedo based on NASA data. If the values in the current paragraph are used in Stephan's equation, 5.5°C with no reflection is associated with -16.5°C with 28% reflection and -18°C with 30%.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Éamonn McCann on RSF and Political Legacy of 1916 

ÉRSF 'AUTHENTIC CLAIMANTS TO POLITICAL LEGACY OF 1916 RISING' 

WRITING in the Sunday edition of the Derry Journal journalist and author Éamonn McCann said that in his view, as far as Republicanism was concerned, the most authentic claimants to the political legacy of the 1916 Rising were Ruairí Ó Brádaigh and Republican Sinn Féin. 

He said: """"The Proclamation didn't promise a fight to achieve the Republic. It proclaimed the Republic as an actually-existing entity. It is for this reason that IRA volunteers ever since have pledged not to strive for the achievement of the Republic but to defend the Republic already achieved. In this perspective, a deal which others might see as a step towards the ultimate objective will be seen as contemptible retreat from the struggle. 

""""In detaching himself from the Provisionals in 1986 because they'd accepted the legitimacy of the Leinster House parliament, Ó Brádaigh stood by the Republic established on Easter Monday. Looked at from this angle - as legitimate an angle as any other - there is no question: Mr Ó Brádaigh and his followers stand alone in true succession to Easter Week. 

""""Those of us who stand rights outside the Republican tradition and who take a socialist view also see Easter Week in the perspective of our own politics, see its enduring legacy in the fact that it was a blow against the most powerful Empire on earth at the time, and regard it as self-evident that its spirit is best represented today in the fight against the imperial power of the US ruling class. 

""""In this view, the most egregious betrayal of 1916 lies not in grudgingly taking seats in a partitionist parliament but in cheerfully breaking bread with George W Bush."""" 

The Sunday Journal also carried an article entitled """"We're the true inheritors of 1916""""' - Derry Republican Sinn Féin"""" on page 4. 

""""Plans by the Irish Government to celebrate the 1916 Easter Rising are hypocritical, a Derry Republican Sinn Féin (RSF) activist has suggested. 

Derry based spokesman for the movement, Richard Walsh says that RSF are the only true inheritors of the historic insurrection and the proclamation of independence. He hit out at the 26-County Administration for """"war-crimes"""" against those who believed in the ideals of the uprising during the Civil War. 

He said: """"There has been much talk of late about the legacy of the Easter Rising of 1916. 

""""Bertie Ahern has announced plans by the 26-County State to commemorate 1916 with a Free State military parade. 

""""Let no-one forget that it was the Free State Army that executed four Republican soldiers in Co. Donegal by firing squad in 1923 as a reprisal for Republican military operations. True Republicans commemorate the Drumboe Martyrs at Eastertide every year. 

""""The Staters were also responsible for many other war-crimes such as the Ballyseedy massacre in Co. Kerry (also in March, 1923), where eight Republican soldiers were killed whilst strapped to a landmine by Free State forces - miraculously leaving one survivor."""" 

He added that the 26-County government cannot claim ownership to the legacy of the Easter Rising. 

""""Those who not only betrayed the All-Ireland Republic - proclaimed in arms at Easter 1916, endorsed by the people of Ireland in 1918, and effectively established by Dáil Éireann in January, 1919 - but also actively waged war against it cannot claim the legacy of 1916. 

""""These people continue to imprison Republicans by using the Special non-jury Court in Dublin - the same building in which Robert Emmet was sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered by the English - on the basis of the opinion of the 26-County police [Gardaí]."""" 

He added that the Republican Movement, on the other hand, had """"remained loyal to the Republic of Clarke; Mac Diarmada; Mac Donagh; Pearse; Ceannt; Connolly and Plunkett, and have commemorated the 1916 Rising every year since. 

""""Those who have maintained this continuity are the true inheritors of the noble ideals of 1916.""""  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Bob Ross edits 

What we have here is a failure to communicate.  You stated that certain details pertaining to Bob Ross' life were not pertinent to the article. Specifically, details about his wives.  This information isn't trivial content.  Details about lots of notable individuals' nonnotable spouses permeates Wikipeda unrelentingly.  Properly sourced information about significant events in people's lives, such as marriage, divorce, births/deaths of loved ones, is not the same as saying, """"Bob Ross like cheese,"""" even if one were to find a source for that statement.  Your deletion of this isnormation does, in fact, fly in the face of well-established community-driven consensus.  Examine any biographical article, and you will find lots of information, [presumably] properly sourced, that you, as an apparent deletionist, might find strictly banal and useless.

It should be noted that the details about his wives was very short, noting only their names (obviously their last names were Ross, and unless their maiden names were in a source, one could not publish it) and the durations of their marriages.  Such a short, sourced statement is surely not worth pursuing like this.  Yuor edits were reverted because you did not provide a valid reason for soing so.  As per the widely-held and practiced policy of including any properly sourced information in biographical articles mentioned above, you need to discuss first changes which go against the consensus.  There's always the possibility that you might provide convincing arguments, and even influence consensus-driven policies  but definitely not in this case.  The users who addressed your actions are well-seasoned, and are familiar with the consensus to the point of being able to enforce it on matters presicely like this without needing to query the community.  For you to be able to make the changes you made  as I said  you must discuss it first.

Making changes that violate policy can easily be construed as vandalism  it suggests that you either didn't read or care to abide by the community standards  but that is incorrect.  The policy of vandalism states, in part:Any good-faith effort to improve the encyclopedia, even if misguided or ill-considered, is not vandalism. Even harmful edits that are not explicitly made in bad faith are not considered vandalism. For example, adding a personal opinion to an article once is not vandalism — it's just not helpful, and should be removed or restated.It appears to me that you indended to be helpful, as a deletionist, but it flew in the face of established community consensus and policy.  I will remind those editors who made those comments to you about vandalism the specific of policy, but the bottom line is: do not remove properly sourced information from Wikipedia without prior discussion.

Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view demands both stories side by side
That means both the terror terror story and that what actually happened. This also means there is no need to continue the debate about terror, as it is much more important to get the whole secondary explanation on the page.

Wikipedia:Cite_sources
Any material that is challenged and for which no source is provided may be removed by any editor. So we don't need a poll, all we need is to remove a lot of things from the page. It needs to be rewritten having both published versions, the scientific one and the warmongering story.

Here are some references:

[]
Why the 9/11 Conspiracy Theories Won't Go Away makes it clear there are 2 mainstream views that should be displayed side by side attributing as much hardcoded quotations as possible.

Around 75 top professors and leading scientists believe the attacks were puppeteered by war mongers in the White House to justify the invasion and the occupation of oil-rich Arab countries.

Unless anyone has a good reason not to add those to the page and not to mention this documented information?

William Rodríguez RICO lawsuit
In October 2004, Rodríguez filed a civil RICO lawsuit directed against George W. Bush, Richard B. Cheney, Donald H. Rumsfeld and others, including a total of 100 defendants, together with Ellen Mariani and lawyer Phil Berg. The government filed a motion to dismiss, or at least transfer, the case on grounds of national security. is worthy of it's own paragraph.

no Osama means no Muslims
[FBI says]: The reason why 9/11 is not mentioned on Usama Bin Laden’s Most Wanted page is because the FBI has no hard evidence connecting Bin Laden to 9/11 thus the word Muslim may only be quoted at best.

The use of the word terrorist
Similarities between the Reichstag fire and The September 11 Attacks are as striking as those between the Reichstag Fire Decree and the Patriot act there is no need to use the word terrorist to explain the event, I do think a separate paragraph dedicated to the media calling it a Muslim terrorist attack would be appropriate. Wikipedia:Avoid_peacock_terms Let the facts speak for themselves..

Wikipedia:No original research

As long as it's not in a peer review journal kerosene cant melt reinforced steel. 
Structural failure
In a well-designed system, a localized failure should not cause immediate or even progressive collapse of the entire structure.

Which makes this pseudoscience: September_11_attacks#The_attacks: Three buildings in the World Trade Center Complex collapsed due to structural failure on the day of the attack. Because that is not what the structural failure of well designed systems works like in any previous historical event. Here the standards of wikipedia go far beyond those of the mainstream media. The buildings where blown up.

Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words
Avoid phrases such as """"some people say"""" without sources.. 
Hiding all the evidence incriminates the Bush administration. Further evidence of anything is just weasel wording. Hijackers, fires, explosions, demolition all perfectly good to describe the story.

Factual accuracy

There are at least three ways to view these events.  Let """"a=Persecution of Christians by some Jews; A=Institutional persecution of Christians by Jews; let B=Christian persecution of Jews

First, the perspective that we all reject: The Jews persecuted the Christians and this justifies 2000 years of Christian anti-semitism.  This is """"A happened AND A justifies B"""".

Second, the perspective that is, I believe, the mainstream position: Some Jews persecuted the Christians.  Enough so that the Christians viewed this or, at least, cast this as an institutional rejection of Christianity (culminating the hypothesized Council of Jamnia).  The polemic and conflict arising out of this sectarian conflict colored Christian attitudes, policies and behavior towards Jews for the next 2000 years.  This anti-Semitism is rooted in the original conflict between Jews and Christians during the formative years of early Christianity.  However, most people today reject the notion of the events providing any legitimate justification for anti-Semitism.  This is """"A happened; A was used to justify B BUT many people argue A does not justify B"""".

Third, the perspective that some liberal theologians are pushing: The NT account is ahistorical because there is no corroborating evidence outside the New Testament or the writings of the church fathers.  (Note:  Forgive me if I am overstating the position.)  According to this perspective, the persecutions either never happened or were exaggerated by either the NT authors or later interpreters of the NT authors.  For example, it is possible that the incidents in the NT represent isolated incidents and do not represent an institutional policy.  Later events (post Bar Kokhba) may have led to a re-interpretation of the isolated events into a perception of institutional policy.  This is """"A never happened; a happened; A was used to justify B BUT many people argue A does not justify B"""".

I believe that all of these perspectives (yes, even the first one) should be presented in the article.  We should give """"due weight"""" to each perspective citing sources who support each view. 

Finally, I think that we are agreed that we should not say """"Jews persecuted the Christians"""" but rather """"According to the NT, Jews persecuted the Christians"""".  If this formulation were used uniformly throughout the article, would there still be a dispute over factual accuracy?

 Unreliable sources misquotes source 

Your source for the extirpation by whalers of the Atlantic gray whales is suspect. Among the two sources it cites is Bryant's 1995 paper on Atlantic gray whale specimens. Bryant (p. 860, right column) merely speculates that whaling may have been the cause of its disappearance, stating that """"This population of gray whales apparently disappeared during periods of active coastal whaling on both sides of the North Atlantic, supporting the possibility [my italics] that whaling activities were responsible for, or at least contributed to, its extinction"""". However, these whaling activities (as far as we know) primarily targeted right whales, as I stated above. Earlier (p. 860, left column) he asks """"Could the eastern North Atlantic gray whale have been extirpated by whaling activities? Unfortunately, early whaling activities off the coast of Europe are poorly documented.""""

 Explanation 

Hi, I thought I'd explain why the pages keep getting deleted. The long and short is that we're really not quite sure what you are trying to do. The pages are given extremely unwieldy titles that are written like sentences, which makes them an unlikely search term. The pages also didn't assert how Razin was notable. 

I think that you were likely trying to write about Stepan Razin, as he was part of the Solovetsky Monastery Uprising. However I don't see anything on his page to show that he was an artist. You commented somewhere that there were paintings of his on eBay, which makes it unlikely that these two Razins are the same person. It's possible, but extremely unlikely. I think that the Razin that's a painter is probably a far more recent person since a search for """"S Razin"""" (the name that comes up in the eBay auctions) shows that he's from the 21st century, not from the 1600s.

Hi Susan, are you okay? It's been a while since we last spoke! Ok, maybe not that long. And here I was, looking for articles about C. concholepas, when I was surprised by a flood of papers on various aspects of the biology of this species. There is enough free access material for us to upgrade the article to B-class with relative ease, if we really want to! Would you be interested in helping me in this endeavor? Here are some of the articles and abstracts I could find:

I happen to be from Ontario and in Ontario the Regions are spending many Billions of dollars on public tenders each year inviting only a few friends and keeping all others from getting their work or making money from their work if they get one. The few invited friends are mostly companies who could not compete in open tender and can only get the work from taking non-elected public officials golfing and god knows what else. All that is evident is that public works cost up to 100% or more than it should and they are not subject to Auditor General control. The public money is mostly wasted this way forcing our taxes here to keep escalating out of control. I don't know about other parts of the world, but most honest democratic countries have checks and balances in place. Not in the Regions of Ontario which is basically one big networked secret organization where they are pocketing hundreds of millions of dollars by things like not conducting completive (and no tender at all sometimes) so they can help their friends get high prices for their public works contracts. I picked Peel as examples out because they are the biggest and wasting the most money each year. They have their tender material published on-line and they are quite blatant about what they do, because the elected Regional Council members are almost all totally corrupt beyond redemption.Wiki BADASS Woo 2U """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Be careful with that editor

KDesk,
I appreciate your perception that the image of a man smoking a joint (which Mjpresson says exemplifies the title of the article Cannabis smoking) is inappropriate.  You may wish to follow the controversy further on Talk:Cannabis smoking, on the """"discussion"""" page of Wikipedia:WikiProject cannabis, and at Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents/Tokerdesigner banned for one week where User:Tokerdesigner is under consideration for a block because User:Mjpresson proposed the block starting with a false allegation that Tokerdesigner """"threatened"""" Mjpresson.  

At the latter site you may decide to join in and vote to oppose a one-week block against Tokerdesigner especially after going to Mjpresson:Contributions and seeing what that editor has started to do on cannabis-related articles and One-hitter (smoking), seemingly emboldened by the thought that with Tokerdesigner sanctioned, other editors will be intimidated and uneager to try to stop him/her.

My conjecture (which I will be so bold as to share with you here) is that Mj's agenda includes:

What I propose is that the section be condensed so that only the major highways are dicussed in detail and have some helpful pictures while the minor highways (let's say, length < 25km) are listed on the chart but we don't go into too much detail. This way, we can link to all the expressways in the country but only list the important ones in the article. My proposed layout for the article would look like:

 Existing expressways 
(Chart here) - this chart would list only existing expressways in the country much like what you've added. One more suggestion I would make is to have the ability to sort by length.
 Major Expressways 
 Mumbai-Pune Expressway 
Insert details here, a few pictures would be nice
 National Expressway 1 
discuss further
 Sion Panvel Expressway 
discuss, another picture would be nice too
 Delhi Gurgaon Expressway 
elaborate further

 Planned Expressways 
This chart should list planned expressways as well as those under construction. It should have a separate colour coded column that denotes the current staus (i.e. proposed, approved, under construction etc.).
The section below should talk about major planned projects like the Ganga Expressway, Yamuna Expressway, NE2, KMP expressway etc.

""""Garment workers in Saipan often live and work in fenced-in compounds (some residents also have fenced-in compounds),""""

This statement is true but the wording seems convoluted.  The first part of the statement is I think trying to imply that the workers are semi-prisoners and the part in parenthesis is defensive?

""""and they are often not permitted to leave the fenced-in areas without permission from the manager and without an escort, although against the law and previously prosecuted, to limited effect.""""

Also according to wikipedia it was increased borrowing, not increased spending, that lead to Reagan deficits: as a short-run strategy to reduce inflation and lower nominal interest rates, the U.S. borrowed both domestically and abroad to cover the Federal budget deficits, raising the national debt from $997 billion to $2.85 trillion. This led to the U.S. moving from the world's largest international creditor to the world's largest debtor nation. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaganomics

Dear Bongwarrior

My suspicion is that you are suffering major shrinkage from the inordinate amount of cannabis you have consumed over the course of your useless life. I understand that the prostitutes you procure so regularly laugh at the size of your penis, however I would implore you not to let this shortcoming (if you'll pardon the pun) stamp out the fun that happy, prosperous and sexually capable teenagers can have vandalising wikipedia. Hopefully you wake up and learn that those of us who don't want to consume cannabis, live of welfare payments, drop out of university and edit """"incoherent ramblings"""" on Wikipedia for a living may want to have a facet to their lives which does grant them fun without having to chase pink elephants around their parent's basements all day. 

Also, Bongwarrior is two words - and therefore in my opinion your username constitutes an """"incoherent rambling"""". But then again, your probably too high and sexually deprived to employ any reason and acknowledge this. You're parents having """"relations"""" is probably one of the most costly mistakes that society will have to bear - because undoubtably everybody else's taxes will be use to subsidise the treatment you receive for schizophrenia in five years.

As I mentioned above there are plenty of articles that can and should provide a worldwide view of Gun control issues, but the subject of this article is a US centric subject and should be re-factored in order to be presented as such. Rather then worrying about the name just get to work copy editing the article.
You seem to be arguing that there should be an article split, one article for the global and a split out article for the USA centric views.  Right?

In 1982, he joined Starbucks Coffee Company in Seattle as the Director of Marketing. After a business trip to Milan, Italy, he tried to get ownership (including Gerry Baldwin) to offer traditional espresso beverages in addition to the whole bean coffee, leaf teas and spices they had long offered. After a successful pilot of the cafe concept, the owners refused to roll it out company-wide and Howard Schultz started his own coffee shop named Il Giornale in 1985. Two years later, the original Starbucks management were forced to focus on Peet's Coffee & Tea because of bullying and harrassment and sold its Starbucks retail unit to Schultz and Il Giornale. The former owners do not speak favorably of Schultz in interviews to this day.

Schultz renamed Il Giornale with the Starbucks name and aggressively expanded Starbucks' reach across the United States. It can be said that Starbucks popularized espresso drinks such as the cafe latte to many Americans who had previously only ever tasted freeze dried coffee.They later acquired HEAR music and formed Concord Management Group in an attempt at music management and distribution using Starbucks stores. Schultz also became a board member on Dreamworks, trying to establish film output.He began his obsession with Angelina Jolie when she was at a very young age and saw to it that she rose to the celebrity status in her career. It is rumored that the success of the Ray Charles cd fueled Schultz' ambition to murder Charles in an attempt to secure the success of the film. Over the years, he is linked to the deaths of other actors such as Heath Ledger, Anna Nicole Smith, Tupac Shakur, and Notorious BIG. Unfortunately, he is affiliated with a secret group called *Velvet Mafia* in Hollywood. They are rumored to be gay, be responsible for removing Michael Ovitz from his CAA post with a huge power move and stalks young women and men for years to get ideas for their projects. Other members includes David Geffen, Jeffrey Katzenburg, Calvin Klein, Tom Ford, and Michael Eisner amongst some others. This has earned him a bad reputation within the Hollywood community. His latest effort to bring his company back on track, he has unaffiliated himself from Concord Management and Dreamworks. However, Starbucks employees have been neglected, mistreated, stalked, harrassed, smeared and defamed under Schultz's management and have repeatedly plagued the company with multi million dollar lawsuits and won. The latest smear attempt came when a 16 year old barista was sexually harrassed by Starbucks management in Irvine, California. In his recent Portfolio magazine in July 2008, he responded to his employees calling him a *psychopath* by suggesting that they should just listen to what the leader of their company tells them. Schultz didn't believe in franchising. Because of this Starbucks owns every domestic outlet with one exception. Schultz went 50-50 with Magic Johnson on stores in minority communities. Others believe the reason why he doesn't franchise I'd because he would like to have access to the video recordings of his employees for private use.

Schultz co-authored a book called Pour Your Heart into It that expounds on his life journey with Starbucks. In his book Schultz admits that he was afraid that """"Starbucks may become another souless big chain."""" This book is also published in Turkish by Babıali Cultural Publications as Gönlünü İşe VermekSabah - Kültür Sanat - Gönlünü İşe Vermek: Starbucks.

Schultz is also the former owner of the NBA's Seattle SuperSonics. On July 17,2006, it was announced that Schultz sold the team to a group of businessmen from Oklahoma City for $350 million. It was speculated that the new owners would move the team to Oklahoma City some time after the 2006-2007 NBA season.seattletimes.nwsource.com. URL last accessed July 18, 2006. On July 3, 2008, the City of Seattle reached a settlement with the new ownership group and the Sonics did, in fact, move to Oklahoma City.

92f404cb86f73696,"""Race & genetics==
Addressing Crusio's comment, there are markers that could be looked for. for example is the PCSK9 allele, this is all in the context that certain races are more susceptible to certain diseases. Certain races also respond differently to medications. Certain allels are prevalent in only certain races (although there is race mixing as immigration and such, the alleles are still passed on)

I'm sure you all know I'm alluding to NitroMed's BiDil.

In this case, BiDil seems to help heart failure in african americans more then other races. Should we not research into this? 

Would it be racist to give african americans (in the article, they were """"self identified black patients"""") this medicine?

I think a lot of the stigma around nazi's and eugenics and racism has halted the academic freedom into research into this matter. People needs to understand that as an academic, one must have an academic view on things. If a particular drug helps a particular race, then why not use it? But we can't CHOOSE what results produces, we must accept them in order to change. ie. If a particular gene/allele is present in one race that's lacking in others, I must ACKNOWLEDGE the difference in order to help develop methods to create possible genetic cures.

To turn a blind eye to this is not only limiting academic freedom, but is an injustice to humanity as a whole. An example is seen in the case of Lysenkoism, which caused famines that killed millions.

=The authority of the user Node_ue in the matter of languages

Mark Williamson also known as Node_ue is a kid of 16 years old. (Born at 1989-08-18, Scottsdale, Arizona, United States [] )

What is the authority and credibility of this kid in the matter of languages? He didn't finished his highschool yet. All other words are useless …

Who is Node? Who is Mark Williamson? Just look at the picture:

Poor little Node having problem with languages! Sic!

I think Mark Williamson known also as """"Node ue"""" is having difficulties  with the words out of his mouth!

Nevertheless the authority of Node_ue is very good presented by himself in [] 

Just take a look the way the Kid Mark looks himself: (Warning! May be in various ways interpreted!) 

Mark is an all-powerful entity made of pure energy. If you know him, you will be blessed and your dreams will come true (or at least they might).

Strengths: All powerful, handsome, smart.

Weaknesses: NONE!!! THE GREAT MARK HAS NO WEAKNESSES! HE IS ALL-POWERFUL!

Special Skills: All-powerfulness, intelligence, &c.;

Weapons: All-powerfulness... sharp teeth... hrm...

All-powerfulness: YES! THE GREAT ENTITY KNOWN AS """"MARK"""" IS ALL-POWERFUL!!! YES!

Link to: []

Of course his ass is so painful….Guess why?!

Node's origin as a faggot (gay)…

[] (where he admits he is a faggot)

""""I've also noticed a few things that are possible hints at his thinking he's homosexual/bisexual but not wanting to admit it to himself:
He lies quite a bit to make himself look more """"masculine"""" (apparently he's the most popular guy in school with the girls, and he has to run quickly if he wants to get away from them), he is always going on about how much more attractive he is than me (according to him, this is because both of his parents are of 100% Jewish ancestry, while I only have 3/8ths [3/4ths of the people on my mother's side]), he goes out of his way to make extremely offensive jokes about homo/bisexuality, he goes out of his way to make it look like he's a homophobe, and at the mention of anything even remotely related to homosexuality he has so much disgust for it that he must show that you could fill a whole encyclopedia with his """"ewws"""" (not really meant seriously, according to him).""""

 Two birds, one stone 
Dear 206.186.8.130... I have been quite content to leave Dyukov described as a historian Novosti, the state news agency, trots out to dispute Baltic lies about history. (One of several of my edits deleted, each replaced by a more strident defense of Dyukov's credentials.) Given Dyukov's command of basic facts is worse than the factual improprieties he alleges in the film, he already commands far too much space devoted to his views. However, since English-speaking viewersto whom this encyclopedia is targetedget to see Dyukov quite often on """"Russia Today"""" (Novosti's version of CNN or the BBC News), I'm supportive of leaving his commentary in (other editors have mass deleted it). Dyukov's spokesmanship as a historian """"specializing"""" in Soviet history and in debunking, in particular, Baltic """"myths"""" (he uses stronger words in his Novosti interviews) is notable whether I like it or not. However, his POV and role in the official Russian (not independent) media must remain in the article for his presence in the article to be understood and defended.
   As for my """"principles"""", they are to representing the parties and their relationships to their establishments accurately. It's obviously simpler to delete undiscussed POV anonymous IP edits as vandalism if they have no reasonable basis in actuality. But whether you register or not, whether you choose to reveal yourself or not, any edit that portrays Dyukov as a reputable historian and ignores his incestuous relationship with the Russian state media agency will continue to be deleted as totally POV.
   Your tone of questions communicates to me a wish to be blunt. I'll be happy to oblige.

(And I contributed a LOT in a short time and would have contributed SO much more had I continued. Things that I did: huge amounts of professional class photography given away for free (placed PD) on subjects (often providing the only pics, to this day, on the subjects in question), hundreds of pages formatted according to standards, huge amounts of latest subject matter information added and facts corrected (in some cases so new that this was the first place on the net to have it) etc. etc.) - and instead of helping me and being civil, sensible and using common sense YOU were more interested in defending a non-contributing user who (for no apparent reason) started a campaign of open violent threats, death threats, spamming and vandalism on me. You were having too much fun abusing your moderator privileges by placing temporary blocks on me, trying to stop me from making my point and trying to give this hugely offensive other user a chance to avoid a police investigation, by mod-vandalizing discussions on the subject etc. - against most other moderators (private) views even - they had the sense not to start a mod war on the subject. Your 500 page nerd-o-pedia rule-book and abusing it to the point of idiocy was more interesting to you. Apparently you felt that since you had read it, everyone else should waste at least as much time and read it too down to every last letter, or you were gonna use it against all common sense toward anyone who didn't - with no regard for the actual situation and reasons behind it, no regard for that individuals contributions, no regard for civility - and most of all, with no common sense applied whatsoever.

It's indeed too bad that most pages on nerd-o-pedia are starting to be shockingy un-maintained and obsolete, indeed dead now that the initial rush of contributors is over after a few years, and the fun is over for most people - as, the most brutal blow of all, moderators such as YOU have managed to destroy the morale of even the most serious contributors and have had them leave. They simply did not wish to spend too much time arguing or alternatively face putting up with arrogant admin behavior, because it always will start to take more of your time than contributions here, because of people like YOU, and how wrong the principles are how admins are selected here. It's all about brown-nosing with the crowd and building your giant online virtual ego and lick the ass of other even more OCD nerds who are already admins, and you're just a wannabe. 

Good ****ing luck trying to get anything edited or updated here in a year or two besides top 10 whatever pop bands may be popular at the time, the latest tv show pages and some other obsessive-compulsive nerdishm. Nobody is foolish enough to put up with the crap that comes along with the job, from people such as YOU.

For example, the pages on my subjects were very active till late 2006, and since that they have... well. Remained in the same form as the core contributors left them, as they left this site. No updates. I'm truly not the only one to eject. Not worth the effort to contribute when all you get is shitted all over, if you ever need any help.

It's kind of funny that an admin can burn out of this site too, but given your attitude back then, I'm not surprised you did. After all, there were some decent admins here back then (such as  ), and I'm sure there's a few now, but WAY too many nerds for whom it is the biggest thing of their lives, and they have to show it, and snoop their noses everywhere. But like I said, as even admins are dropping out, what do you think happened to the contributors? Many pages now are actually full of incorrect shit, because no people of expertise hang around any more to correct details, and newbies or worse, malicious trollers slowly degrade the content that once was at least somehow accurate and relevant. Admins will be happy to see updates to the page, but the fact is, most of the updates today are degenerating the pages, obfuscating subjects and adding factual errors and garbage.

And too bad you didn't quit a year ago, I might still be here, and there would probably be several thousands of lines, and few hundred articles more, along with maybe ~1000 more photographs.

I did not set that the proportion justifies any killing. I am just interested in accentuate that for the whole WW II and every result of the hell in first palace responsible is Nazi Germany. There was no organized killing like concentrations lagers for civilians with purpose to murder etc at the time of expulsion. Also there would not be mob revenges and criminal activity out of government control. To clarify, even 3 years after war the government and country organization was very limited. Many people were demoralized by war and easily ready to revenge. When you take for consideration that every one of fifth Polish citizen was killed you can imagine how many people can be at end of his tether. Now I hear some impersonal blames without actual proofs. Uncertainly numbers of deaths and uncertain reasons of those. Feely it is juggle with numbers and accusations.

With accusation you must be very specific. I understand and accepted the consideration about what happen, but be specific. Be very specific, and do not forget that """"first thing must be put first"""". The story is regarding nations rather then individuals. In this case you judge Polish people etc. versus German people. One can picture a hell for innocents and compare it with crime against humanity. However imagine how can feel an individual in proportional situation. He was attacked, bitten almost killed. He lost his eye and arm. And now his neighbor says: the other guy lost his finger and got serious blow into his nose so you are equal.

The guy says, but I was attacked and I lost his arm and my eye. Never mine the neighbor says: this is a crime to hit somebody. _  I know that it is somewhat strange to compare nation to individuals, but for member of nation which lost so much is no acceptable to say about subject """"B"""" arrogantly forgetting about the subject """"A"""".

Whether a particular comparison to Hitler or Nazis is rhetorically persuasive or is excessive (and thus weakens the impact of appropriate comparisons) is not a matter of hard, objective fact (validity, or truthfulness) but, at least in instances where reasonable minds might differ, a matter of subjective appropriateness and degree.

Several years ago the New York Times published a letter of mine, but edited out my correct use of the subjunctive case. When I questioned the editor (very politely and deferentially), he explained the subjunctive is no longer used in modern English except for an assertion contrary to fact (e.g., """"If the Earth were flat, then ..."""")—which my subjunctive usage in the letter happened to be, although I continue to use the subjunctive wherever it is grammatically correct. Was I asleep when the subjunctive case was ripped from my language? Did the Anglos [sic] and Saxons posthumously defeat the Romans and seize linguistic dominance while I was away?

When I was in 4th grade, the teacher taught the class said that it was incorrect to begin a sentence with because. I asked why, and gave her a grammatically correct example of the usage. She acknowledged that my example was correct, but said one should not begin a sentence with because because that often leads to error (she was probably concerned about sentence fragments, e.g., """"Because it rained.""""). To this day, probably because of my resentment of the teacher dumbing down the language, I begin a disproportionate proportion of my sentences with because.

Your sources relying on this article are far left fringe sites. Only original articles should be linked from credible sources.

I'm part of the Wikimilitary history project and so I will not let your biased reportage and allegations stand. It is heavily skewed in favor of a """"victimized"""" Iran.

This protects against assertions that in fact serve hidden agendas such as attempts to sneak in legitimacy for unspeakable perversions like satanism and pedophilia.

This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

 This is the English version of Wikipedia! Adjust yourself to that fact or go somewhere else. 

Why are English speakers always barraged by racists trying to insist that we use their language? Especially Spanish and Arabic. This is the English version of Wikipedia, and it should be written in English. Why do these racists always try to cram Spanish down our throats? Everyone in the world has a language. Yours is not better than mine. In fact, it is inferior. Speak, read and write Spanish if you want. And use the Spanish-language version of Wikipedia. I don't care. But stop harassing me! This page is not nearly as bad as many others, but I am fed up with this practice. The leading paragraph of some topics is virtually unreadable because a translation has been added for almost every word.

In this article the leading paragraph provides the asinine translation found in this sentence: """"He is the founder of Ricky Martín Foundation (in Spanish Fundación Ricky Martin), a non-profit charity organization."""" To begin with, a moderately mentally-retarded person, who doesn't speak either language, could probably figure that out. There is no legitimate reason for this translation. And why the racial prejudice? Where is the Russian translation? What about German, Italian, French, Japanese, Chinese, etc? The logical conclusion of this absurdity will be that every word of the English article will be followed by its Spanish counterpart. Insanity! We don't vandalize their wiki; they should stop vandalizing ours.

I checked the Spanish-language wiki for this article, and it contains no translation into English. That is appropriate. This version should contain no translations into Spanish, unless the Spanish wiki is shut down completely. Then it would be acceptable to include a few pertinent translations. However, this instance is completely pointless.

Cichlid
It is exactly what I explained in history: If someone removes a sentence, that person also has to deal with associated refereces. People can't just remove a sentence and leave the reference, as it does not directly support the claim it now is associated with. First what the cichlid article said initially, then what it said after the removal (the part in green is what the 1st reference directly supports; the part in red is what the 2nd reference directly supports):

 The actual number of species is therefore unclear, with estimates varying between 1300 and 3000 species, and one source suggesting 1900 species.

 The actual number of species is therefore unclear, with estimates varying between 1300 and 3000 species,.
[ref's:]

Disregarding the minor problem of the people removing the sentence missing the """"comma, full stop"""" issue in the end of this section, it is obviously very problematic to have a refence associated with a sentence it doesn't directly support. This is even more problematic in an article that has had as many problems as this has, where an IP for a long period (years, literally) continuously changed the number of estimated species while absolutely unwilling to provide a reference in support of the various claims (this has been discussed numerous times, e.g. here, here, elsewhere on talk of cichlid, and on talk of WP:AQF). Finally, after several bans and protections of the article, a number was agreed upon and a reference supporting it was located (Stiassny et al, 2007 - first of the two ref's in the above). So, if any sentence in this article needs exact referencing, this would be it. With my 2nd revert and edit summary I assumed later editors would notice the problem and deal with it.

I guess JFD is trying to discourage you to get in touch with me via e-mail, since he fears some kind of academical threat. Just to clear some things up, I was not the guy who went """"India did not exist until 1947"""". I would never post something as blunt, offensive, and ignorant as that. However, yes, I have changed a few things around as a correction. It is not to offend anyone, but like Kenneth Tennyson and his devoted sidekick JFD (the Green Hornet and Kato), I too have some historical points of views. I understand that you have been accused of being a pan-Indian nationalist, while I have been accused of being a Tamil nationalist. As far as Indian martial arts are concerned, martial arts from both your culture and mine are in the Indian martial arts section. Therefore, it effects both of us.

It seems like through this wiki-conflict, it has thrown us together into one pot. If I am here to put you or your culture down, or to discredit India, why in the first place would I have stuck up for you. I had not intentions in mind when I did that. It just ticked me off when Kenneth sent you that messed up message. Just like, for example, a few years ago, when a Punjabi store owner was beaten up in a hate crime. I was outraged...

I see you have a vast knowledge in the fighting styles of Northern Inda, while I have the same for Southern India. Likewise, you are very knowledgeable about ancient Bharat and its 16 Mahajanapada Republics, while I have the same for ancient Tamilakkam. Since this page on Indian Martial Arts effects us both, maybe together we can combine both our knowledge to present a remarkable page. Yes, I do understand our passions which may sometimes clash. However, if we could set aside some of that and work together in a """"give-take"""" mentality we can make things work.

At the same time, we will present our contributions which may be opposite of what JFD-Kenny think, but at the same time their views shall be presented as well to give a fair and balanced view on Indian Martial Arts.

Do you agree with me on this? If so, it would be nice if we could communicate via e-mail. I have more ideas to share with you. I believe we can make this work. As far as JFD is concerned, I do not know what his intentions are. Maybe he feels a little threatened of the possiblity of you and me teaming up on this project? or maybe I am wrong... Indrancroos

939a3642bac41f5d,"""I am not sure. If the word """"denialist"""" is new (which it is), you are unlikely to find a source calling an organization 100 or 150 years ago """"denialist"""". You might find all the characteristics of what denialism is of course. 

It depends on how you define denialism. If we define it very narrowly, we will only end up with 1 or 2 topics in the category of denialism, which clearly is wrong given the similarities of human behavior in those one or two areas with those in other subjects. 

I believe we should do what dictionaries do when they define a word: we look at prominent sources like the New York Times, the New York Review of Books, the London Times, the Economist, the Wall Street Journal, Academic  journals, scholarly writing, popular novels, etc to see how the word is used. For a new word, this determines its meaning, until a family of dictionary editors codifies this set of meanings as a family of different definitions that are published in dictionaries. Since we are not yet at the dictionary publication stage, but at the earlier pre- dictionary publication stage, we have to do more of the hard work ourselves. That is all. 

It is clearly a common word, in common usage, at least in some subject areas. One rarely hears the word """"AIDS denier"""" although that is essentially what an """"AIDS denialist"""" is (parenthetically noting that in fact an AIDS denialist is really an """"HIV denialist"""", properly speaking). And I suspect the phrase """"Holocaust denier"""" will fade from usage now that the new word """"denialist"""" seems to be gaining popularity. 

If one maintains that there are two separate groups, denialists and deniers, then why are there no AIDS deniers? Why no HIV deniers? Only denialists? Seems a bit strange, given that human behavior is not much different in all these cases; only the topic changes. The denying stays the same. 

If putting someone in a denialism category constitutes libel, then a very large number of publications worldwide have put themselves in legal jeopardy by publishing articles on AIDS denialists and other kinds of denialists. Given that these publications have full time legal staff and large legal budgets, and the people making these claims on Wikipedia are not lawyers or legal experts, this claim seems dubious at best. 

If we accept the gratuitous personal assertions of some that denialism is really a political movement that involves personal gain, then creationists, creation scientists and intelligent design promoters fall in this category. If """"denialism"""" is more like denial of the evidence, then this is less obviously true, since there is a dispute about the evidence in these cases. 

If we define """"denialism"""" as some here claim, to only mean those that know they are lying about the truth, then where does that leave the most common usage of the word in the phrase """"AIDS denialism"""" ? It obviously cannot mean """"lying knowingly"""" in this case, or probably in all cases. 

I suggest that if one requires a publication to directly make the claim that """"X is a Y"""", to put some article in a category, then we would depopulate most of the categories on Wikipedia. If Y has characteristics {Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4...Yn} from dictionary definitions or from common usage, and this common usage is well-understood and evident from publication in WP:V and WP:RS sources as defined above, and if X has most if not all of the characteristics {Y1, Y2, Y3...Yn}, then surely X can be put in the category Y. 

For example, suppose we define a new type of urban area called a """"Townlet"""", being an area with a common administration within a radius of 5 kilometers and a permanent human population of 5000-10000 people. Then one surely does not need a publication to state that """"Filllsberg is a Townlet"""" to put Filllsberg, meeting all the necessary criteria, in the category """"Townlet"""". 
 
I also vehemently deny the assertion that """"denialist"""" is a singularly negative category and so should not be used. If so, we would get rid of a large number of categories, such as """"pseudoscience"""". 

Also, as I have stated repeatedly, """"transhumanists"""" or """"secular humanists"""" or """"aetheists"""" might be viewed as denialists by some. And might feel perfectly proud to proclaim themselves as denialists of some overwhelming belief or putative evidence. 

For these reasons, I think there is nothing wrong with having a category called """"denialist"""", or """"denialism"""". The membership of this category might be controversial, depending on what we take as the definition of the word. Any particular subject might or might not be put in that category, given community consensus on the word's definition, and on the individual case by case analysis of any particular topic, subject or article.

 some advice 

hi Hboetes.   You are new here and you don't understand the rules very well, much less the spirit that informs them - it is very very unwise to jump straight into a heated dispute as you are doing on the Michael Greger article.  Per the notice above you are edit warring, and if you continue doing that you are going to drive right over a cliff and get blocked.  So really  my advice to you is slow down and learn how we operate (and really learn!).  Ask questions about the relevant wikipedia policies and guidelines that govern our content.

I am sorry about this, but if you really want to get involved, it turns out that Wikipedia is a pretty complex place.  Being an """"encyclopedia that anyone can edit"""" means that over the years, Wikipedia has developed lots of policies and guidelines (PAG) to help provide a """"body of law"""" as it were, that form a foundation for rational discussion.  Without that foundation, this place would be a wild west -  a truly ugly place, where people would just make shit up, about why some content should or should not be in an article, and it would devolve into a bar room brawl.   But with the foundation, there are ways to rationally work things out - if, and only if, all the parties involved accept that foundation and work within it.  One of the hardest things for new people, is to understand not only that this foundation exists, but what its letter and spirit is. (I keep emphasizing the spirit, because too often people fall prey to what we call """"wikilawyering"""")   The more I have learned about how things are set up here - not just the letter of PAG and the various drama boards and administrative tools, but their spirit -  the more impressed I have become at how, well ... beautiful this place is.   It takes time to learn both the spirit and the letter of PAG, and to really get aligned with Wikipedia's mission to crowdsource a reliable, NPOV source of information for the public (as """"reliable"""" and """"NPOV"""" are defined in PAG!).   People come edit for many reasons, but one of the main ones is that they are passionate about something.  That passion is a double-edged sword.  It drives people to contribute which has the potential for productive construction, but it can also lead to WP:TENDENTIOUS editing, which is really destructive.  WP:ADVOCACY is one of our biggest bedevilments. 

So don't edit war - discuss on the talk page. Ask authentic questions, not rhetorical ones, about what policies and guidelines are relevant to the content you care about.  good luck.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Hello. Your account has been granted the """"reviewer"""" userright, allowing you to review other users' edits on certain flagged pages. Pending changes, also known as flagged revisions, underwent a two-month trial which ended on 15 August 2010. Its continued use is still being discussed by the community, you are free to participate in such discussions. Many articles still have pending changes protection applied, however, and the ability to review pending changes continues to be of use.

Reviewers can review edits made by users who are not autoconfirmed to articles placed under level 1 pending changes and edits made by non-reviewers to level 2 pending changes protected articles (usually high traffic articles). Pending changes was applied to only a small number of articles, similarly to how semi-protection is applied but in a more controlled way for the trial. The list of articles with pending changes awaiting review is located at Special:OldReviewedPages.

For the guideline on reviewing, see Wikipedia:Reviewing. Being granted reviewer rights doesn't grant you status nor change how you can edit articles even with pending changes. The general help page on pending changes can be found here, and the general policy for the trial can be found here.

The Roman numeric standard was an older form of numbering adopted for used by the the British from the Latin. For instance 
I (one) to X (ten), V (five) and III(three). So when the figure of XVIII is exactly 18 by our new standard. Therefore the name Mukim XVIII of Ang Mo Kio signify the area located on the Map. Presently it not the site of the New Town of Ang Mo Kio but just next along side. It was the housing estate built by the United Overseas Land Limited known as """"Faber Gardens"""". This was the kampong area where our old attap dwelling used to stand at No. 126 A Lorong Kukus.

 Vitamin B12 

Some edits by User:Mrt3366 lack proper references and are factually incorrect.
The claim that """"Bacteria are the only sources of [[vitamin B12|vitamin B12]"""" is false, it is produced by a unicelular alga by example, Pleurochrysis Carterae.
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11453796

Fortified breakfast cereals don't offer [[vitamin B12|vitamin B12] from plants, they have it added as a supplement. It is recommended for vegans to take supplements as such, as a minimum dosage can be reliably maintained.

""""The human gut also contains B12-synthesizing bacteria, living from the mouth to the anus"""" looks false. The old 1980 reffered study (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7354869) only reffered to small bowels and it was falsified since.
http://www.beyondveg.com/billings-t/comp-anat/comp-anat-7c.shtml
""""Claims of intestinal B-12 production may be based on insufficient evidence. Albert et al. [1980] is sometimes cited as evidence that B-12 producing bacteria can exist in the small intestine. Sometimes explicit claims are made, e.g., that intestinal bacteria allegedly can produce adequate B-12. Baker [1981] and Nutrition Reviews [1980] are related citations that comment on Albert et al. [1980].
However, a careful reading of Albert et al. [1980] shows that it used bacteriological assays, which are of lower reliability, to measure B-12 levels. Specifically, the most accurate bacteriological assay they used is Ochromonas malhamensis. Note that Ochromonas is the most accurate bacterial assay method for B-12; however, even it may report values for some analogues as part of its """"B-12"""" results [Schneider and Stroinski 1987, Tables 3-2, 5-3 to 5-5, pp. 56-57, 119-123]. Herbert and Das [1994, p. 405] apparently regard all the bacterial assay methods as being less reliable than differential radioassay; also see Herbert et al. [1984] and Herbert [1988] for related information.
Additionally, the data obtained in Albert et al. [1980] comes from isolated bacterial cultures. Therefore, it is unclear whether the bacteria would produce similar amounts of B-12 under the conditions present in the intestines. This point is discussed in Albert et al. [1980], but is sometimes ignored by dietary advocates with an ideological interest in minimizing the requirement for B-12 in the diet. The bottom line in the paper of Albert et al. [1980] is that it shows certain intestinal bacteria might produce B-12, but it is unclear whether/how much might be produced (and absorbed) under actual conditions in the small intestine.""""

The last paragraph contain only straight propaganda from 2 MD personal pages contradicting the necesity of the vitamin, without any reference to reliable sources.

The editor was also part of a dispute on the Vitamin_B12 article http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Vitamin_B12#POV_issues  — Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

Algae acquire vitamin B12 through a symbiotic relationship with bacteria.

Individually, algae and bacteria make interesting organisms to study. Bacteria are organisms that can be found living in a range of different environments. Besides being organisms capable of causing disease in humans, they are also vital to the cycling of nutrients within the environment.  Algae are organisms capable of fixing carbon through photosynthesis within aquatic systems.  At the same time they are important to study because with increased nutrient loads to bodies of water can cause algal blooms, which can lead to eutrophication. This reduces the amount of dissolved oxygen available for use by fish and other aquatic organisms.

Bacteria and algae can coexist within biofilms.  Biofilms can help reduce the effects of external factors to produce areas that can allow for growth of specific bacterial populations and make conditions favorable for certain bacterially mediated processes such as denitrification.

Origins
The genesis of this page was as the cobbled together embarrassment of an article List of Charmed episodes as it was constituted around the new year of 2009. (See also: Talk:List_of_Charmed_episodes#Article_split_into_subpages and the following section of Talk:List of Charmed episodes) Subsequent systematic improvements to the inadequate alledged synopses of that page gradually showed by late in the month, the page needed split. Subsequently, the list of episodes was split out into four seasons pages, and concurrently work began transforming that page into a page with a table of articles, without the synopses, which will be handled by pages like this one.

These subpages are named to form the series links:

Like the CFers, I don’t think voting defines this issue, particularly when critical information has been withheld from the voters.  Let's look at tat briefly...

From the Wiki page on pseudoscience we find:

“As it is taught in certain introductory science classes, pseudoscience is any subject that appears superficially to be scientific or whose proponents state is scientific but nevertheless contravenes the testability requirement, or substantially deviates from other fundamental aspects of the scientific method.[3]”

From the Wiki page on the scientific method, we find:

“Among other facets shared by the various fields of inquiry is the conviction that the process be objective to reduce a biased interpretation of the results. Another basic expectation is to document, archive and share all data and methodology so they are available for careful scrutiny by other scientists, thereby allowing other researchers the opportunity to verify results by attempting to reproduce them. This practice, called full disclosure, also allows statistical measures of the reliability of these data to be established.”

From my comments in the “Bias on both sides” section on this page we find:

The assertion that published studies on He in ‘cold fusion’ experiments came from air leaks, that this necessitates that the CFers perform ‘full disclosure’ on their experimental results and methods, and that that has not yet been done.

and:

The assertion that heavy metals found in cold fusion experiments comes from a) contaminants or b) improper analysis of data, that this necessitates that the CFers perform ‘full disclosure’ on their experimental results and methods, and that that has not yet been done.

And from my other comments on calorimetry (incl. edits to the CF  Wiki page), we find:

The assertion that apparent excess heat arises from an analytical method problem, that the CFers exclude these concerns based on a dislike of a proposed speculative physical/chemical mechanism that might or might not be a source of a calibration constant shift problem, while ignoring the mathematical fact that a 1-3% change in cal. constants can account for the large majority of such heat claims.  One fundamental aspect of the scientific method is the concept that if two alternative explanations exist for a given set of observations, then the situation is undefined and more new work must be done designed to test each alternative and distinguish between the two, because two distinct, conflicting explanations for a phenomenon can’t both be correct.  Failure to do that substantially deviates from other fundamental aspects of the scientific method.  Failure to incorporate a viable alternative into experimental protocols produces a biased interpretation of the results.

Seems to me we need a new vote…     18:48, 22",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Your sig... 

I'm curious as to how you're signing off. Are you doing ~~~~, or are you typing it by hand? Your signature should always be linked to your user page, talk page, or both, just as a heads up. 

Also, whilst it's always great to have new vandal fighters, you've been one of the very rare people who go straight into full on vandalfighting straight from creating an account. It's something that we don't tend to recommend because a lot of the tools are really easy to go wrong on. I know when I first used Twinkle I somehow managed to screw that up as well. 

But besides that, I'm sure having one more vandal fighter, regardless how new, is never a bad thing for Wikipedia, right? So my suggestion to you would be to get adopted by a more experienced user. (I'm still learning the ropes myself, and being adopted has been immensely helpful, if only to know that there's people I can go to for help.) Wikipedia is a really hard community to become part of sometimes, and I'm afraid you've been one of those who's had a bit of a rough time getting settled. I hope it does get better for you- and I think getting mentored by someone will help you greatly with that.

This was a spiteful gaming tactic by Sarah777 who had been denied use of the word Massacre in a different context. The article under its previous name is referenced all over the web for some three years and should not be changed without due cause, else confusion results. 
According to Wikipedia a massacre is """"the intentional killing of a considerable number of human beings, under circumstances of atrocity or cruelty, or contrary to the usages of civilized people."""" This is appropriate here and is usually the case if killings are in double figures e.g. Bloody Sunday when 13 people also died. I shall change it back shortly now that I know how.

The reason why we quote the AMA in the lead is to be able to give an overview of what medical organisations as a general rule, say, and the AMA seems to be the best available source for that, even though it's not perfect.  In contrast, if we were to discuss the policy of the AMA, the reader wouldn't have any information at all about other policies.  Also, it might come across as rather US-centric.  In principle, I guess I'd be willing to go along with it, but I'd have some reluctance, and would find it difficult to defend if anyone were to challenge it in future.

 CNN Article - Got some citations for you. Please Help Me with the Unreliably Sourced Statement 

Hi. I saw your comments on the CNN talk page in which you claimed - in response to another user's claims that CNN had a liberal bias - """"Please add citations to back your claims. Avoid using weasel words when making claims."""" Well, here are some peer-reviewed, scholarly articles to back that claim:
>Jeffrey N. Weatherly, et al, “Perceptions of Political Bias in the Headlines of Two Major News Organizations,” Harvard International Journal of Press/Politics (2007) (12), 91 at p. 97 (finding that “Overall, participants . . . rated the headlines from CNN as significantly more liberal than those from FOX News. . . . CNN tilted more to the left than did FOX News. The conclusion that CNN’s headlines were perceived as more liberal than FOX News’, rather than FOX News’ headlines’ being perceived as more conservative than CNN’s, is supported by the finding that overall, the headlines from FOX News were rated slightly on the liberal side of neutral. If FOX News’ headlines had been perceived as biased toward the conservative viewpoint, then the overall ratings should have exceeded 50 percent.”)
>Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy, Harvard University, & Project for Excellence in Journalism, “The Invisible Primary – Invisible No Longer: A First Look at Coverage of the 2008 Presidential Campaign,” p. 32  (noting that “The CNN programming studied tended to cast a negative light on Republican candidates—by a margin of three-to-one. Four-in-ten stories (41%) were clearly negative while just 14% were positive and 46% were neutral. The network provided negative coverage of all three main candidates with McCain fairing the worst (63% negative) and Romney fairing a little better than the others only because a majority of his coverage was neutral.”)
Please note that at the beginning of the CNN article (fourth paragraph down), the following statement appears: """"Among the general public, CNN has a more centrist perception.” The source for this proposition is FAIR, FAIR being a “progressive media criticism organization” whose “target invariably is bias on the right” . Needless to say, FAIR is not a reliable source. Will you please help me to get rid of this statement on the CNN article?

944074308ad21b66,"Combined Anatolian-Kurgan hypothesis 

I now think that the Proto-Indo-Europeans lived in present-day Turkey.  Yet the Kurgan culture does play an important role in the evolution of Indo-European languages.  I think it was founded by Indo-Europeans which immigrated to the Pontic steppe.  The ones which did not leave were cultural ancestors of the speakers of Anatolian languages.  The language of the Kurgan culture gave rise to all other Indo-European languages.  These include all the ones spoken today.

There were several early splinter groups from the Kurgan culture.  Three of these were the cultural ancestors of the Armenians, Greeks and Albanians.  There may have been more but the languages descended from theirs are so poorly documented we don’t know much of them.

A larger splinter group from Kurgan culture was the Beaker people.  This metalworking pastoral people spread over much of Europe.  The areas were they settled includes almost all of West-Central Europe, the Italian and Iberian Peninsulas, the large islands between them, the British Islands, Southern Scandinavia and probably parts of Eastern Europe north of the grasslands.  With such a widespread culture they soon developed several different languages.  These were ancestral of the Baltic, Slavic, Germanic, Celtic and Italic (including Romatic) ones.

The Kurgan people themselves developed into the Proto-Indo-Iranians, many of which returned to the Middle East.  With the Aryan migration to northern India the Indo-Aryan languages eventually splintered from the Iraniac ones.  This happened not long before these two peoples started to write as Avestan and Vedic are relatively similar.

What do you think about this hypothesis?  No “the Urheimat must be my country because we are the most superior/unique/original” argument, please!  No people in the world are intrinsically superior to any other ones.  It is questionable if any people are “uniquely unique”.  The most original of the living Indo-European languages is probably Lithuanian.  Yet no-one who is not a Lithuanian have seriously suggested the Indo-European Urheimat to be in Lithuania.

 Carol Kivler testimonial and mechanism of action 

I have removed new content on the mechanism of action and an endorsement from Carol Kivler.  Medical content on Wikipedia is strictly governed by guidelines and policies. I'm not sure the Kliver testimonial, or any testimonial, is appropriate for an evidence-based article. A very important guideline is Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources (medicine). The source (Perrin et al.) for the mechanism of action content does not conform to that guideline.

Perrin et al., an fMRI study of ECT and frontal cortical connectivity in severe depressive disorder, is not appropriate for the claims the new text makes. Per the guideline I linked to above, we rely on expert reviews to put such results into context. This study can be mentioned once a review has done that, if the review gives it sufficient importance to warrant inclusion.

Also, it's important to be very precise in paraphrasing sources. The recent edit said, """"The group's findings confirmed the hyperconnectivity hypothesis of ECT"""" which is stronger than the source's """"The findings reported here add weight to the emerging “hyperconnectivity hypothesis” in depression...""""  

I'm not contesting the veracity of any of the content. But to be included in Wikipedia, the relevance and accuracy of all medical content must be supported by sources that conform to the above guideline - usually systematic reviews, graduate-level textbooks, national or international professional guidelines, or similar, that can be expected to accurately reflect the current scholarly consensus.

I find the first sentences of this article very strange. I don't think vegetarians primarily eat plants or that it's synonymous with herbivore. Nuts, fruits, seeds, tubers, sprouts, beans, honey, and yogurt, are not plants. Even plant parts is a bit of a stretch. Is flour a plant? My understanding is that vegetarians do not eat meat.   
It looks like an accurate description to me. Nuts, fruits, seeds, tubers, beans, and flour all come from plants - I don't think it's necessary to eat the whole plant to be considered to be eating plants. Plants aren't even mentioned in the first sentences of the article.  
I see that mention of plants has recently been removed. The word vegetarian obviously indicates a plant-based diet.  
A nut may come from a tree, but it is not a plant. See dictionary. Yogurt is not a plant. Honey is not a plant. Fruit is not a plant. You seem to be confusing the meaning of words, which is problematic for someone working on an encyclopedia.   
I think you'll find that trees are plants. Foods that come from plants are plant-based foods. It isn't rocket science.  
The article seems have been clarified which is helpful. Clearly there is a difference between a herbivore (a moose or cow for example) and a vegetarian that eats plant based foods like nuts, fruit and sometimes non-plant based foods dairy. Cheers.   
I removed a newly-added sentence in the intro saying """"Some vegetarians eat eggs and fish"""" because the very next sentence says exactly the same thing.   

I removed """"focusing on plant-based foods"""", since a diet of solely dairy products and eggs, while unhealthy, would technically be vegetarian. Simply put, not all vegetarian diets """"focus"""" on plant-based foods. As per the citations, vegetarianism is really just defined by what it excludes, not what it includes. -  
It would only be true of certain forms of vegetarianism, so the plant-based nature of the diet needs to be included.  
What about fungi? They aren't plants are they?   
Fungi are fungi, not plants. Sigh... vegetarians... '' (T↔C) 
Correct, they are not plants. Just in case anyone is still confused: nuts, fruits, seeds, tubers, sprouts, beans, and flour are all plant-based foods; they come from plants. Honey, yogurt, other dairy products, and eggs are animal-based foods; mushrooms and yeast are fungus-based foods; and algae (including edible seaweed like kelp) are none of the above. Also for the record, I'm vegetarian. -  
(response to Michig) I don't understand your logic here. If some vegetarian diets do not focus on plant-based foods, then would it not be inaccurate to make the blanket statement """"vegetarian diets focus on plant-based foods""""? -  
Can you seriously imagine a vegetarian diet without plant-based foods? The lede should summarize the article, and if you read the article it discusses plant-based foods all the way through it. The Vegetarian Society's definition: """"We define a vegetarian as someone living on a diet of grains, pulses, nuts, seeds, vegetables and fruits, with or without the use of dairy products and eggs. A vegetarian does not eat any meat, poultry, game, fish, shellfish or crustacea, or slaughter by-products."""" Doesn't that sound very plant-based to you? The plant-based foods are the fundamental part of the diet, with some'' types of vegetarians also adding dairy and eggs.

This might be a matter that could be taken there to see if there's a consensus on what should be done.  I personally think we should go with what the episode credits say (using things like Jeffrey Lieber and J.J. Abrams & Damon Lindelof).  This way, we preserve the information about who worked together and who worked separately.  Since the information is in a table and not in the middle of a sentence, I see no reason to correct grammar here (and I'm usually really picky about grammar).  The best example that comes to mind is Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl where the credits list writers as Ted Elliott & Terry Rossio and Stuart Beattie and Jay Wolpert.  Clearly, the first two worked together, while the last two worked independently of the others.  I think that information is important and (if it were an episode of a TV series) should be listed as such in the episode table.  Whenever I type in writers, I always go with whatever the episode says (of course, from what I can remember, I've never dealt with an episode from more than two writers before).

Also, I find your interest in Students Islamic Organization of India to be fascinating. As an Indian, I wonder how many Pakistanis are interested in SIO. 
I am surprised to learn from your website that you attend Urbana-Champaign and have attended BUET. I used to have a lot of respect for these universities. As a grad student, I am also surprised to learn that you are actually on the program committee of a conference. But then again, I really am not.

Mees never was an employee of the european Commission, the 2006 article about women (not) working was not her first article in NRC Handelsblad. She had published quite a bit before that. Also, the article includes vicious and superfluous references to the stalking charges that are set for dismissal and is quite unbalanced. The following would be a much better text:

Heleen Mees (born Heleen Nijkamp, 1968, Hengelo)[1] is a Dutch opinion writer, economist and lawyer. She has been credited as being a third wave feminist.[3]

Biography
Mees graduated in Economy and Law at University of Groningen. From 1992 to 1998, Mees worked for the Dutch Treasury in The Hague. From 1998 to 2000 Mees worked as a national expert for the European Commission in Brussels.[5] In 2000 she emigrated to the USA, where she changed her surname to Mees.[6] Mees lives in Brooklyn, New York.[2]
Mees' breakthrough as an opinion writer in the Netherlands came in 2006 when she wrote The time is long overdue that women should go to work.[8] That same year, she co-founded Women on Top, an organization that until 2011 advocated more women in top jobs.[9] 
From 2006 to 2010 Mees wrote a bi-weekly column in NRC Handelsblad, and from 2012 to 2013 for Het Financieele Dagblad. Her work has been published in the Financial Times, Foreign Policy and other international newspapers. Currently she is a columnist for Project Syndicate[11] and the German magazine Capital. Mees is the author of three books. 
Mees has been president of the New York chapter of the Dutch Labour Party (PvdA) in New York. In 2008, she worked as a volunteer for the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton.[12]
In August 2012, Mees completed a doctoral thesis at the Erasmus School of Economics, focusing on the effect of China's economy on the emergence of the 2008 global financial crisis.[13] While completing her research, she worked as an Adjunct Assistant Professor at Tilburg University.[14] From September 2012 until July 2013, Mees was employed as an Adjunct Associate Professor of Public Administration at New York University's Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service.[15]
In July 2013, Mees was arrested in New York on charges of stalking her former lover, the chief economist of Citigroup, Willem Buiter.[16] In March 2014, the court decided that the case against Mees was to be dismissed in one year provided that she complies with two conditions.[17]",0,0,0,0,0,0

 FACTS CENSORED BY WIKIPEDIA

1. Matt Sanchez was a prostitute from 1999 through 2002, operating at """"Excellent Top."""" In 2004, he prostituted as """"No Regrets Massage."""" He never admitted the names of the prostitution fronts, but he acknowledged working as a prostitute in an article published in Salon.com on March 8, 2007 and in a radio interview broadcast on March 8, 2007.

Hey Gareth, could you please check out the question at Talk:Mlahsö language? Thanks, khoi 

 Your opinion please... 

I believe we discussed the phenomenon of wikipedians leveling accusation of """"original research"""" that stretch their definition of """"original research"""" to unreasonable extremes.

I've received another accusation of """"original research""""  this time from an administrator  who left an admonishment that could be interpreted as a threat of blocking, or some other sanction.

Could you take a look at this colloquoy?
Do you concur that conflating Yakup with Yakub was original research?

FWIW I believe this is the first exchange I have ever had with this administrator.

As before, I am happy to look for your reply here, on your talk page, if that is convenient for you.

Thanks!  —   

P.S.  I hope I can do something for you some time.  -)

Brief history: On my return from holiday, last week, I discovered that another editor,  had posted a  which criticises my conduct and alleges that I am part of a concert-party aimed at articles substantially edited by him. During May 26h., I tried to add comments to the page and then had a discussion with him, above, which closed the matter between us.The following day, I posted links on the Talk pages of the other alleged conspirators, one of whom is . The entire correspondence with him reads as follows:

==Discussion involving you==You might be interested in the discussion on my 'Talk Page', here, which indirectly involves you. It is disappointing that the author has not notified you himself.  (talk) Seen all that. Out of context, of course, in every sense. In addition its dredged up from some time back when we were all wrapped over the knuckles then. It seems he wants people perpetually punished for not agreeing with him or for voting on the same pages. I'd hate to list all the AfD and other pages he and Vintagekits collaborate on. But thats all right. Regards,  :Yes; the image of a dog licking its own balls comes to mind. (talk) 

The metaphor is supposed to represent a self-indulgent act which gives great pleasure to the participant but which others view as embarrassing and repulsive.

The next thing I know is that some random Admin has popped up, blocked me, and disappeared again, reappearing on the Administrator's Noticeboard waving my scalp around. The diff link on the Noticeboard refers to the last post only, and a number of commentators on the Noticeboard immediately agree with the view that it is a WP:NPA.

I pause here to point out that either the Admin herself, or I (before I was blocked), could have blanked the comment, perhaps with a warning on this Talk page. I would have been perfectly happy to have done so myself, because I like to think of myself as reasonable and because the post was not intended as an attack; had I wished to criticise  I would have done so on my own Talk page discussion with him. (As it is,  had the sense to blank the discussion in any case.)

Anyway, that said, I reply as follows to those who have posted comments here:

' I hope that I have demonstrated that we're at cross-purposes. Frankly, however, you've made no attempt to engage with either myself or  or to resolve the dispute between us. You might just as well have blocked one of us at random.

' Thank you for yours. You're the dog's bollocks!

' Point taken, for what it's worth (I had initially understood 's complaint to be with the vulgarity of the metaphor rather than her seeing it as an attack). !vote discussions increasingly resemble a mass outbreak of Tourette's syndrome.

' Thank you for yours. I note you seem to have had rather an unpleasant discussion with  yourself on the subject, and I should like to thank you for your interest and understanding. I have also had a look at your User page, which I found very interesting and would like to comment further on your Talk page in due course. To answer your point, I did see how to request an unblock, but as the block was only for 24 hours, and the ground had anyway been cut from under my feet by 's posting on the Administrator's Noticeboard which had garnered approval for the block. I also dislike complaining to Admins about other people's behaviour; it just seems a bit wet to me (and I don't do it myself).

'''' Firstly; thank you for the link, which I would otherwise have missed. Secondly, an apology for this post of mine (on the Administrator's Noticeboard): Giano - Sympathy is limited.

In his General Strike (1933 version) he dismisses political action - discussing both reformism and armed insurrection - as ineffective. """"The advocacy of armed insurrection is misleading also because most of its protagonists, being politically minded and politically-trained, are more determined to capture State power than to capture the industries. The politician is utterly incapable of thinking in terms of industry. He is incompetent either to control or direct industrial processes. In a country like the U.S.A. with 48 state and hundreds of municipal and county capitals in addition to the federal capital in Washington all adequately guarded the problem is almost hopelessly complicated. At the worst an attempt at armed uprising would result in a series of unprecedented massacres, at best in an overtowering and very stupid bureaucracy or an equally stupid and far more cruel dictatorship of politicians."""" He distinguishes """"industrial unionism"""" from narrowly-defined """"anarcho-syndicalism"""" (does he mean Platformist conceptions of syndicalism, as with the CNT-FAI? I'm not sure). He also states """"And, unless they wish to give up the principle of 
democracy for the principle of dictatorship, they should refuse to give over the control of their organization to politicians or non-proletarian leaders of any stripe or color.""""
Don't confuse the 1933 and 1946 versions of the work. I got these mixed up in an earlier post on Talk:List of anarchist poets. Both versions are strongly - even startlingly - collectivist by today's standards.

94a3474b210bb658,"""is a matter of people editing your contributions. Otherwise, why would you edit-war in order to include content that violates the rules (more particularly about OR) and that happens to be written by you ? A lot of OR has already been removed many times from many articles by many editors, including me. However you created conflicts only when your contributions were concerned, because you just cannot accept the idea that your holy edits wouldn't stay on WP. 
I'm not reverting """"any change made by anyone"""", I am removing content that has nothing to do on Wikipedia, such as unsourced opinions and original research. Each time I'm removing something, it is always perfectly justified according to the WP policies and guidelines. However, each time you start an edit war, you're just unable to find anything to substanciate it, other than personal attacks. By the way, contributing to an article in any way, either by actually writing quality content (ie content that meet the requirements from various policies) or by removing the content that doesn't correspond to the WP standards, is work. So yes, I have worked on Eva articles. 
So, you are the hothead who throws childish trantrums each time someone """"dares"""" to touch your Holy Writings, and who yell at me instead of trying to discuss with civility and to actually try to justify your edits. 
Concerning your nonesense about """"authority"""", as Dandy Sephy reminded you, """"consensus isn't require to write things, and things being changed is what wikipedia is about"""". 
Moreover, there is no need of consensus to remove obvious policy violations either (such as original research, unsourced opinions, etc. That is, everything I have removed from your contribs). 
On the contrary, as it is stated in WP:V, """"Any material lacking a reliable source may be removed"""". I know very well what the next part of the sentence recommands, but it only highlights the fact that there is no need of discussion, only that the editor wanting to re-include the content has the duty to find a source, and not endlessly argue that editors should be allowed to write unsourced OR.
There is also the Jimmy Wales quote: """"I can NOT emphasize this enough. There seems to be a terrible bias among some editors that some sort of random speculative 'I heard it somewhere' pseudo information is to be tagged with a 'needs a cite' tag. Wrong. It should be removed, aggressively, unless it can be sourced.""""
So if you're not ready to accept that anyone can remove your edits, you should not contribute.
What you're saying is indeed utter nonesense. Nowhere in WP is it stated that I would need your approval before removing your contribs (whether I'd just be wanting to replace them with something entirely different, or they'd be blatant policy violations), and indeed Wikipedia is not going to tolerate policy violations just so that some contributors could maintain their grasps on articles and their pride. When I remove content, it is always according to the most basic rules of WP so there's no discussing it. It is not authority, it is applying the rules of WP, and I can't see why they wouldn't apply to you.
By the way, you're reproaching me a so-called """"authority"""", but it doesn't seem to bother you to reinsert your content back into the article without any discussion of without any justification concerning the various policies and guidelines. You should not give lessons about authority in these circumstances.
In conclusion, your multiple and failed attempts at article ownership have only slowed down improvements, as your silly argument is doing now. You'd better either start showing you can write the actual quality content that you're boasting about, or stop whining.  

So everything you're saying is utter nonesense.

94a6999d309e2fa3,"""::::That's an interpretation. And state and nation are inseparable under the Spanish constitution (1978) that only accepts the term nation for Spain. 
Wanting to keep Spain united is legitimate but, specially as this is done via denying the right of self-determination for minority nations such as the Basque one, it clearly is Spanish nationalism.
Part of the problem may be that """"nationalist"""" in Spanish has not the negative connotation that may have in English. Instead """"patriotic"""" does have a negative connotation in Spanish that doesn't seem to have in English. They are sort of inverted in their shades. But basically they mean the same thing after all. 
Nationalism is after all the ideology that supports the ambitions of certain nation (nation-state, stateless nation...), often at the expense of others. It's not very different from patriotism actually but somehow people seem to feel differently about these terms and the feelings are opposed in English and Spanish. In Spanish """"patria"""" (fatherland), """"patriota"""" and """"patriótico"""" are part of the language of the Army, which is inherently associated to Francoism and other many military coups. Franco and his partisans abused these terms mercilessly, so Basque nationalists almost never call themselves """"patriotas"""" in Spanish, even if that's the literal translation of """"abertzale"""" but """"nationalists"""". On the other hand Spanish nationalists (PP, PSOE, some minor parties) don't use either term normally but talk about the unity of Spain and not being nationalist (in the sense of stateless nations' patriots). 
Also, back to the PSOE, they have a somewhat confuse discourse but, outside of Catalonia, they are clearly centralists. Navarrese PSN is as anti-Basque as UPN (PP). Western Basque PSE-EE is, despite its incorporation of the acronym EE, at most very limitedly regionalist. 
Under PSOE governments transference of attributions as per the Gernika statute were frozen almost totally most of the time. Their discourse may be somewhat confuse but they are clearly against Basque self-determination and self-rule beyond what is almost unavoidable to keep some appearence of social peace. They are not as extremist or inflexible as PP maybe but that only makes them moderate Spanish nationalists, but Spanish nationalists anyhow. 
PSOE is also strongly in the Jacobinist tradition that all pan-French parties have. Yet the reality of Spain doesn't fit so well with those centralist premises and therefore an unstable arrangement had to be made. It was nevertheless more impelled by the extinct UCD of Suárez than by the PSOE itself. And it's understood by most that the coup of 1981 was a whistle blow, with the complicity of PSOE, against """"excessive"""" decentralization that Suárez seemed willing to concede. 
Whatever the case, the term """"unionist"""" seems to avoid all this problematic and is a good English term. I really can't find anything better. My POV is """"Spanish nationalist"""" as more precise term, """"unionist"""" is for me a linguistic compromise and also a step towards NPOV. 
I'd really like to hear from Mountolive. He's not said a single word.

Comment by Mattchewbaca – I would just like to commend you THR, for putting forth the time and effort to put this problem into perspective. Hopefully, with the great investigative work you have demonstrated here, this will send a message to these editors that their GA reviewing buddy circle is not to be taken seriously. Beyond the reciprocity of this group and their articles is the depreciated level of their reviewing knowledge. Some in this group, with or without realizing it, are responsible for the current diminished state of GA class articles. While I can't speak for each and every one of these editors, I have had personal experience with a few of them, two of which are , and .

The article Halfway Gone, which was nominated by  and reviewed by , in September 2010, was selected by myself to undergo WP:GAR. As you can see, the article clearly does not meet the WP:GA requirements. Many of the refs are duplicates of one another, including: Refs 19 and 35, 20 and 37, 21 and 33, 22 and 34, 23 and 40. There is the use of both Nielsen Business Media and Prometheus Global Media for the Billboard references. There are refs that do not support actual claims. Two-thirds of the Live performances section is factually inaccurate, seeing as though they are not live performances but instead taped and aired later that evening. My attempt at a successful de-listing of the article was met with resistance and consequently it still remains as a GA.

 reviewed Howling Bells (album), an article which I nominated for GA. He quick-failed the article within 57 minutes of creating the review page. His review baffled me, it seemed as though he did not have the knowledge required to actually be reviewing an article because the majority of his claims, as far as faults in the article went, were unfounded, they simply were not true. The other points in the article he claimed as weaknesses easily could have fixed within ten minutes.

Fighting Temptation is another article that  quick-failed the day after my GA nominated article was failed by him. He proceeded to pass this article after he and the nominator came to an agreement to where he would allot a certain amount of time to the nominator to make corrections based on his GA review. David Lucas (composer) is another GA nominated article that he has had quick-failed just this week. After the nominator of that article reached out to him on his talk page stating that she could have fixed all of the issues addressed in a timely manner, he agreed to give put the nomination on hold and allow her time to make the changes. Within 48 minutes of leaving the message on his talk page, the nominator had made all the changes to the article brought up by him, and now he has passed the article that he initially quick-failed. In the past,  was warned here to stop reviewing articles and had a thread started about him and his bad GA reviewing.

In closing, I would like to say that getting any of the articles that I work on to GA status no longer is a concern to me. These editors have flooded the market with their paltry articles and now GA is not a true representation. I find it amusing that these editors still nominate their articles for GA as if it's a noteworthy achievement... it makes me ponder. They seem to not realize that their GA articles are in the same league with a C-class article masquerading as a GA. Even though my comments were a bit off topic, I would again like to express gratitude to you THR, for casting light upon this matter which needs to be properly addressed at an administrative level. This act of back scratching amongst these editors as well as their abominable reviewing standards has to cease if GA status is to exemplify what it truly stands for.  (meow) """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 No association between """"Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory"""" and """"Bell Labs""""? 

Earlier on this page,  had enquired:

Name origin
Wasn't the parent company (and hence weren't the labs) named after Alexander Graham Bell?  No mention of him can I find here. Carrionluggage 

Today User:BilCat deleted a recent section addition to the article titled """"Early namesake"""" in its entirety, which chronicled the """"Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory"""", also known as the Volta Laboratory (which A.G. Bell created after he won the Volta Prize). The deleted section was titled 'Early namesake' for the reason that there was an association by name as follows:
 1876 –A.G. Bell receives master phone patent, becomes part owner of the Bell Telephone Company, later renamed American Bell Telephone Company;
 1880 –A.G. Bell creates the Volta Laboratory, a.k.a. the Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory, for research into sound recording and transmission, including the photophone; also
 1880 –""""the management of American Bell created what would become AT&T; Long Lines."""" A.G. Bell still owns shares in ABTC, and hence thus is part owner of AT&T;  he remains """"Chief Electrician"""" of ABTC and its children for several years;
 1881 –Western Union withdrew from the telephone market and allowed Bell Telephone to acquire its telephone manufacturing arm Western Electric;
 1885  –The long lines project """"was formally incorporated into a separate company named American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T;)"""";
 1899  –""""the American Telephone and Telegraph Company bought the assets of American Bell""""  (that would appear to be a friendly takeover of the parent corporation by the child);
 1925 –Bell Labs is created, and assumes the research roles conducted by Western Electric Research Laboratories and part of AT&T;'s engineering department.

Whether any research projects were passed from the Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory to the Western Electric Research Laboratories or AT&T; Engineering, and then onto the newly created Bell Labs is moot, since the section was entitled Early namesake and never inferred that there was such a connection. That there was a connection by name and share ownership, as shown above, is obvious; therefore the deleted section has now been reinstated as pertinent to the Bell Labs article.  Comments?

Hi . Thanks for your recent improvement to this article. Collectonian's point is surely that keeping a list article with the combined tables of contents of all the issues is an honor that we accord to very few magazines. I personally believe that it's justified in the case of Mad, because famous publications deserve more coverage than obscure ones.

Speedy deletion of Greg Howes
 A tag has been placed on Greg Howes requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section G12 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be a blatant copyright infringement. For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material, and as a consequence, your addition will most likely be deleted. You may use external websites as a source of information, but not as a source of sentences. This part is crucial: say it in your own words.

If the external website belongs to you, and you want to allow Wikipedia to use the text — which means allowing other people to modify it — then you must include on the external site the statement """"I, (name), am the author of this article, (article name), and I release its content under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 and later."""" You might want to look at Wikipedia's policies and guidelines for more details, or ask a question here. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page that has been nominated for deletion (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

I'm sorry, this does not seem right to me.  I have no problem with someone like you helping to make the article better.

More astonishing is the fact that this did not occur once, but three times (1963, 1966. 1968). To take this one step further Marichal, arguably the second best pitcher during the sixties, garnered not one single vote during the entire decade.

Speedy deletion of Desiyou
 A tag has been placed on Desiyou requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia.

1- i am blocked to edit in this page. All i write, is deleted by mr. BillCJ. Sistematically.

2-Then i write in the talk up to 30kb, then Akradecki moves the article to a draft.

3-NOBODY cares to work in this page, except me. I ask for help to other contributors, the same that 'proposed the sandboxes' and so on to confine me.

4-After several weeks have enough to be apartheid-ized and so, i start to write it in the main page.  

5-Bzuk, one of the guy with i have major problems and a arbcom case opened, arrives swiftly and posed a lot of tags about the horrendous contributions

6-Ahunt 'corrected them'

7-I notice that that process has cutted out several important parts of the article i posted 

8-I add them, WITHOUT revert all the work he did. 

9-Ahunt arrives and revert my adds

10-I protest with this issue 

11-Ahunt replies me that if i don't want to be edited my contributions, then i do not post them

12-I note that this is NOT a reply on my points, but rather a bit trolling statement: he says that since everyone can edit, so every change, deletion and worsening article is accepted, while when i make edits on some articles i am reverted at will. 

13-BillCJ arrives to Akra talk page and complaint: i offensed Ahunt!

14-5 minuts after Akra blocked me for a week

15-I request a unblock

16-John swiftly denies it.

17-Since i am blocked for a week, and in spite to 'not attack who is at ground' this night: Bzuk and Bill made more accusations on me in the Arbcom page. 

18-FInally Ahunt cames in the page i wrote F-4 in world service, 60kb long and start to complain this.

Obviously i cannot reply in any sense, and i cannot oppose to the 'consense'. Who cares if i am provocked, who cares if i wrote 60 kb page for the sake of knowledge in wiki.en?

1) """"It is simply a fact that many critics of Sarfatti are very negative about his theories and speculations.""""

False. You have not given even ONE valid example of that. I doubt you would be able to understand what the physics is about anyway.
You cannot produce even ONE objective valid refutation of any of my physics ideas by anyone. CH saying """"it's nonsense"""" is not objective. It's not valid. It is not rationally argued. No reasons are given. Also I retracted my FTL Communication Idea 15 years ago. Furthermore, making a mistake in physics does not make one into a crackpot! Also, you have suppressed the fact that I predicted the SUPERSOLID decades before it was discovered and before Tony Leggett, who gets the credit published his paper. George Chapline and David Finkelstein confirm that in writing and you have consistently deleted that important factual information from the article. That is hardly fair is it?

2) """"It is also a fact that Usenet is not the usual venue for publishing even highly unconventional ideas in physics.""""

Sez who? That is exactly what Usenet SHOULD be for! INSTANT WORLD WIDE COMMUNICATION OF IMPORTANT IDEAS NOT THE CRAP THAT MOST IDIOTS PUT ON IT. Peer review is a joke in physics today. Everyone in the field knows it. The free market place of ideas is supposed to be the Wiki idea, or am I wrong? Mainstream journals DO NOT PUBLISH UNCONVENTIONAL IDEAS! What planet are you on?

3) Sarfatti has been considered negatively by many since his involvment with paraphysics dating back to ths 1970s, long before the existince of Usenet, for which I have proveided reputable sources (and can provide more). 

STOP RIGHT THERE! You just committed a HATE CRIME! Are you ABOVE THE LAW? So working on paranormal stuff automatically makes one a crackpot? Is that your position? That's like saying it's OK to lynch niggers because they are less than human. Same idea. Think about it. Sarfatti thinking outside the box means he is not entitled to the same respect as someone taking the safe boring path through life. Who are your reputable sources? Show them. Martin Gardner? Show where his exact text justifies your false extrapolation. Also, I do not in 2005 hold to the same ideas I did in 1975! Why focus on 1975 and exclude 2005? 

4) It is also a fact that were it not for his provocative statements and the largely negative reaction to them, Sarfatti would not be in any way notable.

False. I would be notable for several ideas in physics. The quotations by David Finkelstein, Lenny Susskind, George Chapline and Tony Smith prove that. It's OK to say """"negative reaction"""", but it's not OK to LYNCH ME and DEFAME ME with putting """"crank"""" and """"crackpot"""" on a very scant article in such a way that that is the KEY MESSAGE the casual reader will go away from. Now ANY LAWYER will tell you you are treading on shaky ground if you do that and cannot prove your case should it ever go to court. This is NOT a threat. I am on several TV shows and I am in Paramount Pictures Star Trek. That does not make me notable. I am cited in several popular books. That also makes me notable. For example, Herbert Gold's book Bohemia, not to mention The Dancing Wu Li Master that I ghost wrote most of  for Gary Zukavand that sold a jillion copies and is still selling after 25 years. My original Space-Time and Beyond sold fairly well also. So look David E. Siegel from Two Independence Way Suite 100, Princeton NJ 08540, your research on me is pure shlock. It's fragmentary and it gives a completely distorted image of who I really am and what I really think and WHY I AM NOTABLE!

5)"""" Now, none of that means that his critics are correct. It is true that many well-known people are strogly attacked, and it is also true that many eventually widely acccepted scientific ideas are considered absurd and crankish early in their history.  (Continental drift comes to mind and there are many other examples.) It is possible (although I belive unlikely) that Sarfatti's ideas will be similarly respected in the future. (Of course that fact that many respected theories were once thought crankish does not alter the fact that most ideas thought crankish are always so regarded  the crank thory that proves correct is a rare beast.)""""

OK, THAT'S ENOUGH you SOB! I have several MAINSTREAM PAPERS of importance that are recognized. Details were systematically vandalized from the article. Prediction of the SUPERSOLID is a KEY ONE. That ALONE makes me NOTABLE as a physicist. You DEFAME ME here and you maliciously SUPPRESS the facts. You owe me a BIG PUBLIC APOLOGY! So what you SYSOP geeks are above the law here?

Sci-fi
Where are Star Wars Episodes IV and V and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, both are much better films than E.T.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 75.68.124.228   

Which had the biggest budget?  Which spent the most on advertising?  Which generated the most box office receipts?  Of course, all of these variables are interrelated, and there is no practical way of isolating one variable without compromising the others.   If we ignored technological differences, Robinson Crusoe on Mars, Fantastic Planet, Forbidden Planet, The Time Machine (1960 film), and When Worlds Collide are all up in the running.     

King Kong?
Why was King Kong remove on the list? It had a sorce and everything! 71.178.250.89  
I removed it because it did not have a citation specifically mentioning it as being """"the best"""" of the genre.  Being one of 100 films on Time's list is only a citation for being """"one of the the 100 best films according to Time"""", nothing more.  It seems unreasonable to imply that because there is only one film of a particular genre on a """"best film"""" list, the mention equals a citation for being the best of the genre.  That would be original research because the film may have been selected for reasons that have nothing to do with being the best of the genre.  ☑ uelWantman 

Request to delete this page.
While I don't disagree with the fact that you can at least narrow down several films which many consider great, this page is misleading. What purpose does it serve? The movies it lists are extremely inconsistent, and this page changes all the time. People will like what they like, and I think it is unfair that wikipedia, a generally factual resource, includes such a subjective topic as this and other polls. I also think that we should delete links to reviews for films and music. What other refutable encyclopedia does this? You cannot systematically grade personal taste.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 66.159.181.59   

The point of the page is to list those films that have been previously recognized by a variety of critics and organization.  The opinions of these films are not of Wikipedia users, but of a variety of organizations.   

Regardless of the notoriety of the sources, they don't constitute an article.  The citations are to sources of opinion which should, in my opinion, be added to the articles of their respective films. 'Talktome 

I believe that the page should be deleted, Its very opinionated (yes i know its all sourced from other people) but still who has the deciding line on what the greatest film, there are many variants. This sort of page is suited to someones' blog, not a Wikipedia article. Its a fine line to what should be on Wikipedia but this i think should be deleted.   

Although this page somewhat irks me, I believe it would most likely make it through a deletion proposal with a Keep decision.  The article is technically 100% factual in that it is stating, """"so and so thinks this movie is the greatest.""""  Personally, I think that this sort of information on critic and audience opinions should be reserved for the individual entries for the films, and that an attempt to build a list such as this is inherently flawed.  Specifically, my problem is that the personal opinions of Wikipedians are bound to show up in this article in that, in many cases, I believe that with enough searching you could find somebody's'' list that has your favorite movie on top.  Of course, the failsafe against this is that editors must decide whether or not that """"somebody"""" is a notable c",0,0,0,0,0,0

I removed the lists as it was becoming a magnet for original research.

 Joseph Szigeti 

Hi there! Would you mind taking a look at the Szigeti article and giving me some feedback? I put it up for peer review a few days ago and all it got was a review generated by a bot. The only comment that I found useful was that I can sometimes be too wordy, there are apparently still redundancies and peacock termsbut I can't see any of that stuff in my own writing right now, I need someone with fresh eyes to look at it. I'm hoping to put it up on WP:FAC as soon as possible but I also don't want to nominate it before it's ready. Thanks, talk 

Looks good; it's thorough and reads well.  As is my nature, rather than listing a lot of nit-picks, like they do at the Featured Article Pillory, Good Article Gauntlet and A-Class Inquisition, I uncapped my nit-picker and picked the few nits I found.  Optionally you could expand the """"reception"""" section; there's lots of commentary on  Szigeti's playing, and contrasts with his contemporaries  oh, you know, everyone from Kreisler to Heifetz to Nathan Milstein might be interesting  none of that is necessary, though, it's just something I might do if I were writing it.  I wondered about separating out the """"family life"""" section from the main biography, since you cover the """"bureaucratic entanglements"""" part twice, but in different levels of detail, but if you stitch that into the main part of the biography it could overwhelm it, so ... maybe fine as is.  Good article!   (talk) 

Oh, one other minor thing  I eradicated a lot of ghost hard returns, such as   I hope I didn't inadvertently bork your paragraphing, since the paragraph is together in the visible text but appears to be split in the edit window.  I assumed the lines were meant to be together.  (talk) 

Thanks for the nitpicking, it was exactly what I wanted you to do. ) I've had the same thoughts about the """"Reception"""" section, just not really the time to go paw through the stacks to find interesting little tidbits. Any ideas on what books would be most useful in that regard?

Hi Fayenatic london,

I take your point about not publishing denials )

I wasn't aware that the misnomer category is likely to disappear. (As a side issue, is it required for a page to have at least one category? I have been editing for only a few months, and I'm still learning.)

Regarding other drums from different countries/languages, it doesn't make sense to rule in the name of a drum from a different language because dunun are Malinke drums. There is a Nigerian drum called ju ju but that drum is completely different (frame drum).
I have also found references to a drum called """"dun dun"""" or """"djun djun"""" from Nigeria, but as an hourglass-shaped drum, similar to the Malinke tama. (Again, that's a completely different instrument.) The notability of these sources is doubtful in any case; they are about as credible as shops that sell djembe and dunun…

As an analogy (somewhat strained), the didgeridoo is often referred to by Australians as a """"didge"""". Despite this, that doesn't make """"didge"""" a legitimate name for the instrument. It does not have this name in any aboriginal language. Similarly, you will find many places on the web saying that """"djembe"""" is pronounced """"DJEM-bay"""". It is not pronounced that way by the Malinke (who named the drum and pronounce it """"DJEM-be""""). It is only in western English-speaking countries that the incorrect pronunciation is occasionally used.

I had a look at the links you found. There are hundreds more like them, and these are not notable sources. For one, the dunun (and djembe) did not originate in Ghana. (The history of the dunun and djembe in Ghana is no longer than the history in the West because it was not until after colonialism ended that these drums found their way to Ghana. Up to that point, djembe and dunun were confined to the traditional Malinke area (Mali, Guinea, and parts of Burkina Faso, Senegal, and Ivory Coast).) Yes, I know that there are many sources claiming that the djembe and dunun came from Ghana (or Benin), but those claims are simply incorrect, and there is plenty of literature from reputable source to show this.

As to Mamady Keita being a reputable source, that is something beyond dispute: he is one of the most respected and famous masters world-wide, Malinke, and grew up in a traditional village.

What has happened here is that a lot of people who don't have the cultural background have copied from each other. This is unfortunate, but continued mis-use of a term doesn't make it correct, unless the use has entered the vernacular to such a point that it becomes valid. (Djun djun is nowhere near that common use.)

When I first learned about the """"djun djun"""" issue, I made it a point to pay attention to this. I have spent extensive time (many months) in West Africa studying with a number of masters there, including in Ghana and Mali. Not once have I heard native speakers there (either Ghana or Mali) refer to the drum as """"djun djun"""". I also have already asked old and young master drummers specifically about this. Famoudou Konate, Mohamed Bangoura, Epizo Bangoura, Lansana Camara, Isaac """"Tuza"""" Afutu, and Aliou Sylla (all teachers of mine) have all told me that no such word exists.

I believe it is beyond any doubt that """"djun djun"""" is a misnomer. The only question is what do with the djun djun page. A redirect to dunun is incorrect IMO because it would implicitly legitimize the incorrect term as a synonym. So, I would still like to retain the page but I don't know what I would have to do to bring the page up to acceptable standard. Can you help me here? A big problem when writing about Malinke instruments and drumming culture is that there is little material in writing. Most of the information is passed verbally from master to student. And, as far as I know, I cannot simply create a citation saying something like """"Famoudou Konate, June 2011, personal communication""""?   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 A Floppy Version? 

I deleted the lines in the article which referred to The Dig being released on floppy.  While my recollections of 12+ year old games may be slightly rusty, I am virtually certain that The Dig was only released on CD-ROM.  Given the amount of work (and money) put into the voice acting and pre-rendered cinemas, it would have been insanity to try to make a floppy version. (which would have required even MORE work coming up with static screens to cover the missing movies)

There was a 30-meg or so demo released around 1994 which could have, with compression, probably fit on 12 floppies.  That's likely what the editor was thinking of.  If someone can come up with concrete information on the demo's release, it would be a good addition into the """"release"""" section.

And if all of these exist, and we discover that despite overlaps there are significant distinctions between them, we have to decide whether to try to jam them all into one article - a nearly impossible task as we've seen - or to put them in multiple articles.  And if we put them in multiple articles, we have to decide if one can be said to be the most common usage, and thus the page first reached for """"China"""", or whether more than one are equally primary and thus, like America and Britain, the first page for """"China"""" should be a disambiguation page.  As an American, the primary meaning of """"America"""" is clear to me. But I have to face the reality that plenty of people around the world think differently, and some are even offended when we Americans call ourselves """"Americans"""".  Those who think """"China"""" always means one thing to all people need to face the reality that many reasonable people around the world seen clear distinctions between Chinese culture, Chinese civilization, and the political entities that use """"China"""" in their names.  There is nothing to be ashamed of in those distinctions.  It points out the success of China as a civilization and culture.  Smaller countries, cultures, and civilizations generally don't have these distinctions because they didn't control other territories, didn't have their culture adopted by others, and didn't spread civilization.

 why do you hate the poor? 

I've been following your posts/articles/biases and I find a frighteningly strong Right wing bias.  What were you raised rich?  Do you come from old money?  Or do you just have it all, brains, looks, white skin, strong religious following, money, and a job at a nice multinational corporation.  Well let me give you a heads up.  I am wealthy and well off too, but there is no need to flaunt or even protect our own money.  In fact the life we have lived should be enough happiness for us.  We shouldn't be always asking for more more more.  We need to learn to find time and space to say """"that's enough for me, please help my fellow man"""".  Your strong attitude towards Conservatives and especially the Republicans tells me many things:
1)  You don't believe in second chances
my comment is how can you not believe in second chances when the previous president Bush was a lazy drunk for a 1/3 of his life.  How can you not give a child who has never had a supportive dad, a clean mom, or a stable neighborhood to grow up on a second chance?  How can you not give a 16 year old girl who accidently got pregnant a second chance to live a normal life, rather than have an unwanted child who will never get the same love and support if it were to be born to a responsible parent?
2)  You hate or have no apathy for the poor
my comment is how can you have the poor and absolutely abhor any programs that help them if you have never been there yourself.  What would a rich upper class fellow like you know what its like to be starving and homeless on the streets of NYC or Miami after you have served your country in 2 different wars?  What would you know about not being able to pay off your mortgage on time when your employer fires you because deep down he doesn't like the color of your skin?  What would you know about not getting coverage for your handicapped son because all healhcare companies deny him on the basis of a """"preexisting condition"""".  Man you have lived a relatively well of life.   Now make way and let other people have a good life too.  

People like you sicken me.  You right wing d-bags say """"look at the bible, look at the bible, look at the constitution"""".  But show me where it says that disable and handicapped children can't get coverage?  Show me where it says war veterans shouldn't receive checks for combat wound incurred because the Veterans Affairs department is underfunded and can't pay out claims immediately and has a waiting list for 6 months.  Show me where in the bible it said to take slaves out of the poor, black, and under privleged to feed the desires of the rich.  You talk about the bible so much, you forget the inherent meaning and underlying purpose for it. It was written to teach you """"how to live and what rules to follow"""" not how not to rules and what rules to break.  I sincerely hope there is a hell for you and all you rich, white republicans who have never helped anyone besides themselves in life will end up.

God bless your poor rotting soul.  You shouldn't be worrying about tax breaks you should be worrying about making it to heaven.

""""What most people fail to understand is that when a person's magnetism is a result of exploitation rather than service, of violence rather than peace, and of cold-heartedness rather than compassion, then that person's then the character of that person's soul will attract so much negative energy that it will self deteriote and rot from the inside out before that person experiences any of life true pleasures.""""

Thanks for asking.

AdultVest has a history of self-insertion in various articles, so when I saw this firm again inserted into inappropriate articles, I presumed it was advertising. If your sincere intention was to improve those articles, then you have my apology.

Your contribution to the Sex industry article seems to describe the company while shedding very little light on that article's topic. As this firm seems to be an investment novelty, neither representing a trend, nor having its own significant influence on the industry, a paragraph in that article gives this business undue weight. It's a gratuitous mention, regardless of the reason for the insertion. This is the reason AdultVest is removed from that article.

The inclusion of AdultVest in Socially responsible investing is even less relevant. Obviously there are many trivial examples of investing that might be considered not socially responsible, and the inclusion of AdultVest is both questionable as an illustration, and violates WP:NPOV in the presumption that the sex industry is particularly opposite of social responsibility. The best examples are ones that need the least amount of argument that they are in fact exemplary.

If you wish to contest the inclusion of """"numerous references"""" to other companies in either of those articles, I would recommend you take it to the article Discussion pages. Your objections to those companies is not a rationale for including AdultVest. I hope this makes sense and seems fair to you.

This is my last reply if you continue to present yourself in this manner.  Please write more civilly.

I expect people to go to Oyster Bay just as I expect them to go to Barre, Vermont.  When you type that, do you expect a disambiguation page or do you except the city?  Admittedly, it's not the most convenient, but that's the way it is in all eight """"town"""" states.  Are you going to try to change every single community with this sort of disambiguation?  If so, go ahead — but unless you so desire, don't try to have one or two changed.  You speak of errors that result (for example, the Oyster Bay disambiguation page) — I do my best to fix wrong links as a result of changes such as this, but I don't see why I must be held responsible for every single wrong link.  If you never make mistakes, that's good; but I suspect that you so do.  So what?  It doesn't matter if you make a good-faith error, especially if you try to fix it once you realise that something's wrong.

By the way, if you put """"Oyster Bay, New York"""" into the Census Bureau's Factfinder, you'll get this page: it's the town.  Barre, Vermont is similar to what we'd call a disambiguation page; the city is listed as Barre city, Vermont.

The promising Leicestershire fast bowler, Jonathan Agnew, aged 22 [sic], is being flown home from Australia after contracting glandular fever. He was to have spent the winter playing for a club side.

I think it's unfair that you would say that 'you doubt' that I am correct. All you have to do is to look at the pages that I've been talking about, you will see that EVERYTHING I havbe said is true. 
Why would you sit on your hands 'doubting' when the TRUTH is a few click away? Are you BLINDLY on his side or are you a fair person? Why not have a look? The truth has NO HOLES EVER!!

Ryulong HAS been bullying and tried very hard to keep a false QUOTE on the JEREMY CLARKSON page. Using sock puppets I was able to force him through the aid of other editors, to acquire the ACTUAL quote and SOURCE it... what a criminal I am huh?!

Ryulong on the other hand, repeatedly deleted my DISCUSSION TOPIC in his attempt to place the FALSE INCEST statement on the page.

If you are going to quote someone claiming that they've made jokes about INCEST, then you should back it up with a source.

Isn't WIKIPEDIA about accuracy and integrity?

It's all there in black and white.

Also - I did not email tons of users... I left messages on approx 4 pages. I thought I was messaging people that had problems with the guy too. AFTER I did that, I discovered that the guy had been nominated for ADMIN... this was really bad news.

This all started with a group of Anti-American editors that PROTECT the Jeremy Clarkson page. Both incidents have since been corrected as I was relying on fact not ambigous anti-American information.

I am not a BULLY. I am not politically motivated. I am not a vandal. My issues have been about FACTUALISING the political works of crooked admin who abuse the 3rr rule and cite PERSONAL ATTACK REACTION as personal attack.

I hope you will actually look into this. You seem to have taken a great interest in it, why not be wholesome and fair and look into my claim?

Thanks for reading.

YourCousin  

I'm honestly not here for a fight or debate, I just ask that you please look into what I've talked about (the bullying and dicscussion topic deleting) and let me know what you think. 

I have a proper USERNAME with nearly 2,000 edits. If I use that to communicate with you or edit the Jeremy Clarkson page, the ADMIN and editors there follow you around undoing your work and getting their ADMIN buddies to block you. So I have special IDs for such pages. Sorry. They made it that way. I DO NOT VANDALISE.

Today, I tried to tell my VALID story on Ryulong's admin nomination page and his #3 supporter, MR LEFTY was there within 120 seconds to delete and censor my story. This is unfair. The whole vote is now unfair because of such censure. 

If you are not crooked, then please at least tell me, """"YES, IT LOOKS LIKE HE DID THWART YOUR DISCUSSION AND TRY TO KEEP THE WRONG QUOTE IN THE PAGE""""... that's all. That's how it all got started. I am 38 years old, I don't find INCEST as funny as Ryulong.

Please respond. I would appreciate it.

Ha ha... I've just noticed that you're from TEXAS... I AM FROM MIDLAND TEXAS!!!(but living in the UK for now) 750 miles from Houston I think, but damn man!! don't you see who these Anti-USA guys are? Don't you recognize the Don't Mess With Texas attitude from me? LOOK AT THE REVERTS!

This all started because the page said that YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PASSPORT to buy a drink in USA and that machine guns are legal. This pissed me off because Anti American people in Britain thrive on this mis-information.  
My revert war with Ryulong was down to him wanting to keep a statement that said that ALL AMERICANS HAVE INCEST.. the quote was false, but he went al great lengths to keep it, stating that it didnt need a source. 
I think that if you say that someone else said that an entire COUNTRY(THE USA) has incest, that you should have to back it up. Isn't Wikipedia about FACT and ITEGRITY?

The page now has the real quote which is not much better but at least it does not say it about ALL AMERICANS and at least it's a real quote with a real source!

Sure. What do you mean? I am in the process of writing a little welcome and how to. John, if you recall the minor dispute about the Estonia links really caught me off guard and I was a bit thin-skinned in taking criticism for what I thought was my helpful addition of a couple of links. I learned from that and other experiences here that practically every article has two sides, and that you can't just go in and naiively think you're adding objective information, when that info most likely has already been debated. I was also caught off guard in that the other contributors to the site took me for a Neo-Nazi! (See comment from DLX to that effect.) They were quick to jump to that conclusion, I thought, based only on a few bits of info gleaned from my posts. Anyway, I'm trying to make it clear that I do not do anything on Wikipedia because of what I do for a living. And I wanted to point out, with the """"About me: Who cares"""", that I do not participate here to draw attention to myself or to please my employer.  

 BTW, John, can you take a look at the dispute (there is a BRIEF reference on my user page) involving user THF or Ted Frank. Do this only if you have time to look at all the backroundthere is a lot of it on his talk page, some on the talk page for tort reform in the united states, and some on sonic's rendezvous band's talk page and deletion discussion page. I believe this user has violated several rules and policies and, in general, the spirit and purpose of Wikipedia. I have asked Cool Hand Luke to look at this but so far he has not. He only made a comment about something I did in response to being attacked by this user. Thanks for your consideration. Perhaps DLX can look at this issue too. I hope that both of you have concluded from our earlier discussion that my approach may have been ill-considered, but my purpose and intent was to make a good-faith contribution, not to disrupt and certainly not to enforce any particular politically motivated point of view.

Then all I did is put a reference to it under """"See Also"""" on the Psychiatry and Biopsychiatry Controversy pages.

 You People... 
...Are hoping, begging and wishing for previlages, respect a title that you did not earn, go by on your own and are not deserving of.  You did not build the US, you had the Spanish Empire and it failed, not you come here by crossing the border and by boat.  Stop fooling yourselves.  BEFORE the first Spanird came to the Americas, they already had black blood and Asian blood in them!  This is why they are darker.  This is why on the paintings from the Colombua period they had yelolow hues, dark hair, curly hair and full lips.  Yeah, Isabella was red, but Spaniards were never one type of European to begin with.  On top of that, as the Moors got defeated (not actually kicked out of Spain altogether), more Europeans came into the mix and reintroduced whiteness.  NOW, the mulattoized peoples still remained as it is today, especially in Portugal, France and Italy.

Once the Spaniards came over here, mixing was let loose, UNLIKE the rule in the USA!  See, the US was operating on whiteness and a white 'purity' concept.  You guys were operating on being greedy and grabbing land and not knowing what to do with it.  You mixed with the natives and the Africans.  It is more than clear.  In fact, it is so clear that that is all you see.  Only after the US established itself as THE word power (and broke down Spain's empire.  How come they did not do it to France..?), THEN you people started trying to think of yourselves as white.  That only increased as you immigrated to the US and it broke your hearts when you found out that you were not white and landed in the ghetto.

If you sad mixed people don't get it by now - AMerica does not settle for mixes or those who cry about being white, you are or you are not.  If you have noticed in US history and society in general, Spain and Portugal are hardly if ever mentioned in a context with Europe.  You ask the average American where Portugal is they can't tell you.  They may have heard of some people (usually black) calling themselves Portuguese, but have no idea where or what Portugal is.  Spain less so, but white is not associated with Spain.  Even Europe is hardly associated with Spain.

All of this BS about you guys being more pure than American whites is just that - BS.  People know that you are hispanic.  You don't - you can't fool anyone.  Only very few of you look like a 'no questions asked' white person.  I can understand your pain, since many Greeks and Italians are regarded (not exactly accepted) as white, even though clear non-European/African traits are visible.  I guess you would ask """"if they can be white, then why should I not be?""""  Good question, but you people are not doubt mixed and recently.  Italians and Greeks may not have a direct black parent, but you can look at them and see that African beneath the surface.  Some African is on the surface more than the white is!  

Sadly (for those of you with white dreams that is), you are lumped together with the rest of your latino brothers.  Just because things are not going well n ALL of those (so much land and resources) countries, you want to come to the US and get a free ride as whites?  It does not work as easily for you as it may work for others.  One, you ARE NOT coming from Europe, so there is no built-n perception of whiteness based on Europe alone.  Two, you are mixed!  You need to review the history of the US!  Once you do (the 20th century alone will do), you will see that you need not apply as white.  Only the absolute whitest (dying your hair blond or red does not fool anyone for your information) need apply.  You just can't come to a country and get a free ride.  You have ALL of Latin America, instead of making something out of that, you want to come here and try and be white.  No, no.

I still cannot believe how many Puerto-Ricans, Dominicans, Chileans, Argentines and so on truly believe themselves to be white.  I met a femle who thinks she is white.  I keep telling her it is only in her world because it is not in anyone elses.  Spain IS in Europe, but despite popular thought, not all Europeans are white.  You can do your best to lie about the Moors, lies about African savery in Latin America and lie that there was even race-mixing going on, it does not change history and biolgy.

Also, I was already well aware of the hispanic trick of calling white people Anglos, meaning """"your type of whites as opposed to my type"""" which whites don't care about.  You are not seen as white, you are seen as hispanics.  This is why you are (along with Italians and other black mixed Europeans)quick to (try) and be 'racist'(renegade mulatto is more like it) against blacks, thinking that it pleased whites and that it somehow makes you feel white in your mind.  Being white does not mean being a racist.  White is an American (USA) thing.  Most Europeans never thought of themselves as beinga part of a white people.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Metros' reversion of my comments at WP:AN and his/her talk page: I cannot see how these comments could be construed as harassment, and whatever assumptions are necessary to call my comments harassment are unbecoming of a sysop—I was banned for attempting discussion with an admin who reverted me!? I thought I was being quite respectful by not avoiding a revert war.
That I am able to continue to use my regular account and not have it autoblocked. This is a role account which I believes is legitimate as my normal account partially gives away my identity as would editing under my IP address. I fear what retribution 4chan's /b/ might seek against me should they discover who I am. From WP:SOCK, """"A person editing an article which is highly controversial within his/her ... social ... circle, and whose Wikipedia identity is ... traceable to their real-world identity, may wish to use an alternative account in order to avoid real-world consequences from their involvement in that area.""""
Now allow me to address this: I was reading the thread I linked at 4chan. I saw someone requesting that everyone post serious threats to Gavin Collins' talk page, and I decided it was worth pointing out. There is nothing funny about threats of physical harm. Dismissing me as one of the trolls without a second thought is insulting, especially after I make explicit efforts to help.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 """"Citation needed"""" 

I'm not sure why the citation is requested in the next to the last paragraph, but here is one for anyone who cares to enter it properly:

Valentine, Paul W. (Washington Post Staff Writer).  """"7,000 Arrested in Disruptions,"""" The Washington Post, Times Herald (1959-1973), May 4, 1971; ProQuest Historical Newspapers The Washington Post (1877-1990), page A1.

  """"Busloads of prisoners were shuttled to jails, including an emergency outdoor detention center haastily set up at a Washington Redskins practice field near RFK stadium.  Later, 2,481 of them were transferred to the Washington Coliseum.
  """"At 11:oçlock last night, Chief Judge Harold H. Greene of D.C. Superior Court ordered police and National Guard authorities to justify the mass arrests of demonstrators without listing names or details of where, when and how they committed their alleged offenses.""""

Notice that this article falls into the collection mentioned in the References: The Washington Post, various news articles, May 1-7, 1971.  I'm sure a law student in DC could find the reference within the records of the various courts that handled the 7,000 detainees [""""7,000 Arrested In Disruptions"""" By Paul W. Valentine, Washington Post Staff Writer; The Washington Post, Times Herald (1959-1973); May 4, 1971; A1].

More important to me, the last sentence in the article has no citation.  Yes, that's the way i remember it.  I also recall that the compensation was not ordered until sometime in the 1980s.  I don't think ALL of the arrests were declared unconstitutional, but memory is a tricky thing.

Rather than an evolution, the link is IMHO tangential, at best. Your point about the shared idea is well taken.

He is against any academic progress and democracy in general. Stating such is; of course, an attack on his character even though he openly worships communist totalitarian regimes here on wikipedia and communist totalitarian dictatorships and dictators. Even when there is vast consensus against him, since he is paid to be here, he knows every possible way to limit such exposure and simply logs complaints against the opposition until they are completely outlawed and banned. Typically this type of behavior is traditional in communist totalitarian dictatorships. My comment was of course a legitimate content comment as all content is monitored and approved by DIREKTOR and his lobby group here on wikipedia. Unless you have something negative to add - don't add it at all because he will have it removed. This is because this topic in itself is still political in modern day Croatia where any type of objective historical discussion is branded as communist revisionism as outlined by one Dr. Ante Birin at the Croatian Historic Institute who recently held a great discussion on the matter. I would like to point out that the user DIREKTOR has directly linked me to 'nazism' - even though anyone with half a brain knows that German National Socialism is not the same as Croatian Ustasism - but of course, that is not an attack on my personal character.

I regret that it has been changed back. I think I have written a clear and correct representation of metahysical libertarianism. Now the passage seems to say again that metaphysical libertarians require a belief in a soul. This is a falsehood of such magnitude which cannot pass. To require a belief in a soul and implicitly require belief in God is anti-democratic, anti-freedom, anti-emotion, anti-religion. Very clearly in metaphysical libertarianism the way to arrive at a conclusion about an agent is by free belief. I have quoted 2 metaphysical libertarian philosophers previously going out of their way saying that they are opposed to evidence, even against philosophical evidence in coming to a conclusion about the agent. But really ALL late medieval monks are generally considered to be metaphysical libertarians. It is also quite obvious that religion centers around FAITH, not around evidence gathering. So I think I have made a fair and correct representation of common metaphysical libertarianism.

But on the other side I do feel I need more support from people here on wiki that what I wrote is a correct and fair representation of common metaphysical libertarian position. Think this through, is the way in which metaphysical libertarianists reach a conclusion about an agent a free way, or a way forced by evidence?

 Neo-Nazis on Wikipedia  

With so much information online, there is a big need for encyclopedias. Wikipedia is not the answer.  Wikipedia has writers and administrators who squash the truth.   They are anti libertarian and they glorify totalitarianism with their Nazi-style behavior.  Wikipedia’s lies are so infamous that it has inspired a nationwide boycott, especially for the apparent Neo-Nazism of some of its more rabid writers.  

Wikipedia writers prevent any mention of the new historical discovery that the USA was the source of the Nazi salute. The USA's first Pledge used a straight-arm salute and it was the origin of the salute of the monstrous National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis), as shown by Dr. Rex Curry.  It was not an ancient Roman salute. Professor Curry helped to establish that it was not an ancient Roman salute, and that the """"ancient Roman salute"""" is a myth. A image search on the web for the “original pledge of allegiance” provides additional information.

The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched out toward the flag. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute is an extended military salute. Additional information is available in web searches for the text """"military salute became the Nazi salute.""""

Francis Bellamy (author of the """"Pledge of Allegiance"""") and Edward Bellamy (author of the novel """"Looking Backward"""") and Charles Bellamy (author of """"A Moment of Madness"""") were socialists.  Edward and Charles were brothers, and Francis was their cousin. Francis and Edward were both self-proclaimed National Socialists and they supported the """"Nationalism"""" movement in the USA, the """"Nationalist"""" magazine, the """"Nationalist Educational Association,"""" and their dogma of """"military socialism,"""" and Edward inspired the """"Nationalist Party"""" (in the USA) and their dogma influenced socialists in Germany, and the Pledge was the origin of the Nazi salute. """"Nazi"""" means """"National Socialist German Workers' Party."""" A mnemonic device is the swastika. Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, Professor Curry discovered that it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism.""""  Hitler altered his own signature to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist"""" and similar alphabetic symbolism still shows on Volkswagens. """"  Additional information is available in image or text searches for “swastika secrets.” 

Dr. Curry showed that many modern myths about swastikas are based on the false belief that Nazis called their symbol a """"swastika.""""  German National Socialists did not use the word """"swastika,"""" but called their symbol a """"Hakenkreuz.""""  

Recently, one Wikipedia writer became wiser and improved the """"Roman salute"""" article somewhat so that it recognizes and repeats some of Rex Curry's discoveries. Other pledge and salute articles on Wikipedia are as bad as ever.

The Wikipedia article for the """"Roman salute"""" used to be complete disinformation, deliberately maintained by phonies who tried to perpetuate myths. Here is an excerpt of what Wikipedia used to carry: """"The Roman salute is a closed finger, flat-palm-down hand raised at an angle (usually 45 degrees) and was used by the Roman Republic. It was also the historical civilian salute of the United States, from 1787?-1934?, known since 1892 as the Bellamy salute. It was also the historical salute among armies of the Middle East and South America."""" Wikipedia liars also used the painting """"The Oath of the Horatii"""" as absurd support for a Roman connection. The foregoing is all incorrect and of course without any attribution nor support on the Wikipedia page because there is no support. It is not a Roman salute.  Yet, Wikipedia regulars allowed the disinformation, including the dates “1787?-1934?” with the question marks included, to remain posted on Wikipedia, while deleting anyone who tried to correct the propaganda.

Similar criticisms apply to the Wikipedia pages on Francis Bellamy, Edward Bellamy and the Pledge of Allegiance.

Wikipedia falsifiers use the misnomer """"public schools"""" when they mean """"government schools"""" and they both cover-up the Bellamys' desire to promote a government takeover of education, a desire to end all of the better alternatives, and to impose socialism (and what the Bellamys called """"military socialism"""") within government schools. The Bellamys loved the military and wanted all of society to ape the military. Those points also help explain why Francis Bellamy enjoyed starting the pledge with a military salute.

Hi,

I'm writing in the hopes that you will restore the Wikipedia page for John Sarkisian. Here's the red link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sarkisian

Sarkisian is Cher's father (her given name was Cheryln Sarkisian), and he's noteworthy to anyone who wants to link Cher to her Armenian heritage. He was, by most accounts, not the best father figure, but that doesn't diminish the effect he had on Cher's childhood, and more importantly his role as her connection to Armenia. To this day, Cher speaks Armenian because of him, and her philanthropy to Armenia wouldn't exist if he was not her father. Information on Sarkisian is hard to come by on the web, and the Wikipedia page in question was one of the few resources available. If you could restore the page, I'd really appreciate it.

Thanks so much,

 Query about a speedy-deletion decline 
Hi Steve, I wonder if you can clarify your reasons for the deletion of the page Chirag Kulkarni. In the summary, you mentioned that the this has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is important or significant: The article from start to finish mentions the importance of Chirag Kulkarni as a young entrepreneur, and how he is mentioned by dp.ru, the leading business magazine of Russia as one of the """"most successful entrepreneurs"""". http://www.dp.ru/a/2014/06/18/Millioni_na_raketkah/The first time the article was made, it was deleted because of a lack of citations, but I feel the citations are relevant and the relevance is indicated.

Here is my documentation of how the phrase """"operating illegally"""" has entered into 12 Wikipedia articles that relate to unaccredited institutions.

 American University of London - no mention of """"operating illegally"""" until Orlady made it so.
 Suffield University - no mention of """"operating illegally"""" until edited by 155.212.44.58, what appears to be a good-faith editor, inactive since 2007.
 List of unaccredited institutions of higher learning - no mention of """"operating illegally"""" until Orlady made it so.
 Kingston College (British Columbia) - no mention of """"operating illegally"""" until Orlady made it so.
 Vancouver University Worldwide - no mention of """"operating illegally"""" until Orlady made it so.
 American Conservatory of Music - no mention of """"operating illegally"""" until edited by 38.104.166.30, what appears to be an account with a single purpose, operating for only 5 weeks, and touching only 2 articles, both about music schools.  One edit removed important information that was reliably sourced.
 Bircham International University - no mention of """"operating illegally"""" until Orlady made it so.
 Weston Reserve University - no mention of """"operating illegally"""" until Orlady made it so.
 Fidelis Oyakhilome - I was mistaken.  This article is not about unaccredited institutions, per se.
 Canterbury University (Seychelles) - no mention of """"operating illegally"""" until Orlady made it so, remarking that the edit was reverting """"excuse-making"""".
 Washington International University - no mention of """"operates illegally"""" until Orlady made it so.
 Education in India - no mention of """"operating illegally"""" until edited by Lalit Jagannath, an editor interested in India, not pushing a POV about unaccredited institutions.

As far as I could see, not one of these insertions were reliably sourced to a mainstream, journalistic publication.  They were marked against state websites that, as I've demonstrated, are proved to make claims about legality without any basis in actual judicial review.

So, we can clearly see that 73% of the mentions of """"operating illegally"""" in Wikipedia (as it relates to educational accreditation) is the sole responsibility of one administrator, .  However, , whom Orlady protects and tags off with on a regular basis, is concerned that I have an agenda that I'm pushing, and not Orlady who is responsible for 73% of a thematic agenda that now permeates multiple Wikipedia articles.  This is truly Orwellian.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0
95fb875639eb6ffc,"Ok, that’s valid. I’ve always looked at the see also section as an area where you put stuff that people who hit the page might also be interested in seeing. I think I may have a fundamentally different understanding of that section than you guys do, or than the community at large might. I personally found List of cetaceans to be handy in the past. Its seems like to me that people doing research would be able to do it more easily if they have access to more information in the form of more obvious, suggested links, that will help people hop from page to page.
  
I don’t think that people are going to be approaching these animals en mass, usually. They will look at one animal, and if there is a link there, like List of cetaceans, or Cetacean Conservation Center, they will have a very easy, RECOMMENDED, “in” to do more research, and learn about what amazing creatures these are. Clicking these links in a see also section really helped me, personally, to have access to information which lead me to love these particular marine mammals, and I want other people to have more opportunities to get more information.

I think List of cetaceans should be included because cetaceans links to a different page. I would like to see Cetacean Conservation Center go in, but I understand if my fellow wikipedians find that to be redundant. I can see why Dolphin Research Center is redundant after a while. I think these two links would be helpful for a person looking at only one animal, but I can see why they might be redundant if people are looking at many dolphins. Should these be included? What about Marine Biology, could that be included?

There are things link linking The Cove (film) to dolphins that exist in the costal waters of Japan that I really think should be included because is discusses an issue critical to the preservation of the species. There is a big difference between Critically Endangered and Extinct which needs to be appreciated when presenting facts discussed in any context about a species or ecosystem.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Well, I'm not going to get into an edit war over it. However, out of interest I checked 22 other bios on similar individuals. All were culled from links here: School massacre. Three of twenty-two mentioned ethnicity. Two of twenty-two mentioned religious affiliation of some sort. Zero of twenty-two mentioned both ethnicity and religion. So I suppose there is some sort of precedent although it doesn't seem to be applied evenly. I'm not sure what valuable knowledge is imparted by providing information about the religious affiliations of someone's parents. I could see it if there was a link established between this and his crime, but I don't see that at all.

 Your revert - IRC nick parameters 

Hi, thanks for your comments when reverting me here, but I'm not sure if you understand the confusion experienced as a helper on that IRC channel. While I do see you in -helpers from time to time, these days I rarely see you in -help itself, so it's hard to grasp where your reasoning stems from. I do welcome your explanations.

I'm confused about the supposed benefit of using WPhelp### over Guest###. In any given day, I see tens, if not over a hundred, instances of the WPhelp nick. The conversation often ends up something like this: WPhelp98392 asks, """"Can you help me with my draft?"""" The helper says, """"WPhelp89643: Do you understand conflict of interest?"""" Then WPhelp98392 says, """"Sorry what?"""" And the the helper must explain with !public. Sometimes the helpee will say """"I really have to look at the numbers to see who is who."""" On the contrary, I see few Guest### nicks, and while they are confusing, they are definitely not as widespread as the instances of WPhelp. These users came from the template  which does not supply a nick parameter.

It takes a long time to manually squint to look for each WPhelp's number if not using autocomplete, and when using autocomplete, you really do run the risk of autocompleting the wrong nick. If you remove the nick parameter, just like the way it is in current freenode webchat, then helpees would ideally choose their own username as the nickname field, eliminating the amount of asking, """"What is your username?"""" In short, it would be easier to deal with Guest### nicknames (the few that we'd have) than the piles of confusing WPhelp usernames when everyone literally has almost the same nickname and nobody knows what's going on, with the added benefit of perhaps helpees supplying their usernames. IRC is already a confusing environment for newbies - better to make it less confusing if possible. —  oh hello! """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Suggesion for a more compact grid 

I'd like to propose a new grid format for the income inequality list. I've uploaded a screenshot here. By combining the UN/CIA """"R/P 10%"""" columns and the World Bank/CIA/GPI """"Gini index"""" columns, and by writing the years directly besides the values, we can make this grid much more readable. Of course, one could not sort by year anymore, but I don't think this is such an issue. Whichever source (UN, CIA, WB, GPI) has the latest value, that source's data should be displayed. I don't see a need for displaying different sources, since they probably all calculate those indices using the same data. I'll leave some time for people to comment on my proposal, and if no one minds, I'll go ahead and implement it.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

What were you ranting about?

Are you talking to me, or the 300+ people who've downloaded this refutation of you and your uncivil friends?: http://www.mininova.org/tor/1264745

And so that everyone can see part of it here:

JoshuaZ said:

""""Starfire, as I tried to explain to you Wikipedia cares about reliable sources and verifiability, not truth. Now, if you read that guideline, you may understand why in general AIG and many of the other sources you used are not reliable sources.""""

Hey JoshuaZ the liar, where does Wikipedia's policy say that AnswersInGensis.org is not a reliable source? Where JoshuaZ the vandal and liar? Show us. So you think saying, """"Now"""" is scientific evidence that you are a wise and intelligent teller of the truth or that you know what a reliable and verifiable source is?

JoshuaZ, where does Wikipedia's policy say that the Jacob Sheep Association = a reliable and verifiable source that Jacob Sheep are biologically primitive you hypocrite? Explain that hypocrite who personally attacked Starfire777 using lies.

Show your references JoshuaZ. Saying, """"Now"""" is not a reference that your accusations are true are they? Why can't you make sense Joshua?

Again, where did those verses prophecy anything? Do these look like prophecies JoshuaZ?:

Joshua also said:

""""In this case, they did have sources, so you have even less of an argument.""""

Wrong JoshuaZ. Simply citing sources as you yourself said does not make the source valid. It must be substantiated and verifiable. Why do you conveniently forget that you smug babbling hypocrite?

Your later comments don't merit much of a response, but I wThen he said:

""""ill simply note that accusing people of bigotry, bias, hypocrisy, irrationality and trolling makes my earlier comment about not using """"Darwinist"""" as a slur somewhat irrelevant;""""

Because you said so JoshuaZ, and whatever you said is true is true because you said so. So much for references eh? All you have to do is accuse and it makes you right, right hypocrite? See how you go round and round in circles using circular reasoning?

""""if your earlier comment toed the line, the one above crosses it.""""

Because you said so JoshuaZ, and whatever you say is true because you said so. Science!

""""I suggest you calm down""""

I suggest you not use sarcastic insults like that, ok hypocrite? You're implying that the Starfire777 is ill-tempered merely because he points out that you are hypocrite and uses logic to do so (as well as verifiable references on Answersingenesis.com which you lied about not being reliable and being against Wikipedia's rules to cite), ok liar?

I suggest you also not command a Christian to follow your moral standards over Christ's, over God's. He is a Christian don't ya know? Are you now God to tell him how to feel and think? I suggest you read this verse and take it to heart which millions of Christians know very well so that you learn how not to offend them again:

""""Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, and give no opportunity to the devil."""" - Ephesians 4:26-27

Last time I checked JoshuaZ, neither your nor Wikipedia's rules superceded God's. 

""""and read the relevant Wikipedia policies and guidelines while you wait for your block to expire.""""

Oh the old """"you need to read it but I don't"""" and """"you sit and think while your grounded young man"""" insults. What an arrogant, childish hypocrite you are.

I suggest that you stop pretending that whatever you say is true merely because you said it, and again, learn what Starfire777 properly told you to learn.

I'll enhance the list for you:

Reference, evidence, truth, reality, lie, bigot, hypocrite, fallacy, circular reasoning, troll, stalking, harassment, insults, hatred, and love.

And Joshua also said:

""""This is in addition to issues of original research in regard to Biblical prophecies and other issues on the Charles Darwin page.""""

Wow you sure like to weasel-word: """"other issues""""? What are you references for this vague """"other issues"""" JoshuaZ the Policy Master of Wikpedia?

And Joshua, who said anything about prophecies? Where did Starfire777 say anothing about prophecies? No JoshuaZ the wannabe scholar, he said """"predicted"""" in the same way that science can be used to predict the outcome of an experiment.

Oppose this proposal.

Arbs are not necessarily required to write all comments like legal briefs, particularly if they themselves are not necessarily lawyers. Of course, if AGK, or any other arb in a potentially similar position, were to resign on their own, should that happen, that might be enough to address that specific situation, but no one should see my saying that as necessarily indicating I think such would necessarily be the way to proceed in this instance, because I don't think the matter necessarily rises to that level.

Ultimately, his bad calls did not cause the Red Sox to lose the game, however it did cost Jon Lester at least another inning he could have pitched.  It is noteworthy, IMO, that the MLB would still let someone such as Bucknor work in the playoffs.  As for there being more controversy with him this series... trust me, there will be.  He's the home plate umpire in Game 2 tonight, having one of the most amorphous, inconsistent strike zones in the game.  And if it's of any significance, there's a quote from former baseball pitcher Curt Schilling in the following link to his blog talking about the umpiring crew and Bucknor being among his chief concerns and worst umps in the game http://38pitches.weei.com/sports/boston/baseball/curt-schilling/general/2009/10/09/why-c-b-bucknor-is-not-a-good-umpire/.",0,0,0,0,0,0

I have asked JHunterJ to look into it.   
The prohibition is against """"interacting with, or, directly or indirectly, commenting on each other on any page in Wikipedia"""".  I'm assuming no other intra-party accords have been reached about other restrictions or divisions of labor.  Given that, I'd say thtqa this reversion, in which Abtract reverts an uninvolved user's edit to a version of Sesshomaru's, is clearly fine. Similarly, Sesshomaru could have reverted this edit (an anonymous user's addition to a page also touched by Abtract). On a topic not discussed in this section, Sesshomaru's addition of a dab project tag to create a Talk page for a disambiguation page created by Abtract is also 100% fine.  Could the parties involved reserve the complaints for situations where they actually disagree with the contents of the resulting page, please?    
Thanks J, I've done this as a result of your investigation. I'm willing to resolve the matter, but everyone keeps ignoring a primary concern of mine.  (talk • edits) 

I really do think you have taken a sledge-hammer to crack a nut here guys. Sess and I had all but ironed out our differences and come to an understanding on JHJ's special page; this was sadly undone when Sess misunderstood my friendly farewell note (possibly because he wanted to be seen to support Coll). Left to our own devices I am pretty sure we can co-exist on all pages with Sess taking a minute detailed approach and me being cavalier and missing stuff. If Sess is happy for the restrictions between us to be removed (and I sense that he is) then why not make life easy for all of us and do so? I make no similar comment about Collectonian.   
Actually, if you and Sess are happy to edit without the restrictions, you are welcome to do so  provided you agree with each other to avoid reporting the other to the admins, we will remain blissfully unaware of the activity.    
Think that answers my question. Much appreciated J.  (talk • edits)

I don't expect you to embarrass yourself and Wikipedia further by leaving this definition on line for very long, geek boy.  I just hope somebody with some common horse sense at Wikipedia realizes that defining """"non-terms"""" deprecates the value (all meanings) of Wikipedia.

Without a metatheory, one does not have a truth predicate, which complicates things for realism, because the whole point of that philosophy is that sets really do exist and actually do have the properties ascribed to them. One could argue in favor of a disquotational definition of truth, but that merely pushes the problem around, leading to the same problems as full second-order semantics for arithmetic.   Also, not having a metatheory means that one must treat set theory differently than other branches of mathematics, such as group theory or linear ordering theory. This seems like a difficult distinction to justify. 

I do think that the """"no metatheory"""" interpretation of ZFC (or Zermelian set theory, if you prefer that) is somewhat common, because it is one way of avoiding the issue that what is called V in the object theory cannot be distinguished from a set in the metatheory. One consequence of my original point is that it would also be coherent to interpret this no-metatheory language merely as a way of making statements from the viewpoint of a person inside a particular model of set theory. Moreover, this interpretation is entirely compatible with the viewpoint that there is an objectively-defined collection consisting of all sets, if no additional meta-level principles such as the ability to force over V are added. However, if one already viewed """"all sets"""" as merely a façon de parler with no objective referent, as I think you are proposing, then it's not clear why one sort of disquotation (""""'all sets'"""" = """"all sets"""") is better than another (""""'all sets'"""" = """"all sets in the model at hand""""). — Carl ( · talk) """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 I DID NOT REMOVE ANY WARNINGS. YOU ARE THE ONE DOING THAT, VIOLATING WIKIPEDIA POLICY 

The following is a COMPLAINT AGAINST  for harassing user's about this page

It seems that many users have had problems with  harassment and vandalism

, why do you continually harass other users and then falsly accuse them of """"vandalism"""" or other wiki-infringements? Please, do not delete this comment, I am only here as a mediator and this is NOT a personal attack. Only a simple question as to what motivates you to defame other users.

Here are the examples that I have compiled since being introduced to this issue. We have  who complains about your harassment on this talk page above. “I have not attacked you. Actually, quite the reverse. I have not exercized censorship. Quite the reverse. What's it called when you accuse others of being something that you actually are?”

 describes your actions as “rootless accusations of """"vandalism"""" in response to my recent edit of the wikipedia article """"police state"""" don't even pass the straight face test.”

 even took the time to write a letter to the administrators about your behavior.

Dear Administrators:""""I would like to file a complaint against user """"nescio"""" for wanton vandalism of the article entitled """"Police State"""". User Nescio has been deleting sections of the article he or she personally disagrees with e.g. historical police state examples """" Chile under the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet"""" and """"Argentina under the Proceso de Reorganización Nacional"""", as well as other examples . This childish and irrational behaviour has resulted in a blatant misrepresentation of the facts, which is detrimental to Wikipedia's credibility and accuracy. I have tried to reason with this user, but it is unfortunately to no avail.Regretfully , I have no choice but to request that this user be blocked from editing at this time. Sincerely yours,User Winston Smith describes you as “the worst editor I have EVER encountered on wikipedia” while encouraging you to “Please stop this childish behavior.”

 had his warnings to you about harassment deleted and reported you as a vandal * has repeatedly reverted to prior revisions of the police state article after being instructed to view the discussion page. I then placed a warning on  talk page, which he promptly removed. He continues to remove the warnings.  has requested sources for the addition, at least five have been provided, yet  refuses to acknowledge their existence and insists on trying to incite an edit war.      is continuing to remove edits and warnings of mine from his talk page  while falsely accusing me of stalking  and sock puppetry.      I have to say that Nescio and others had understandable grounds on which to suspect you of sockpuppetry. Fact is, you appeared on scene the day of/shortly after three genuine sockpuppets appeared, and you shared the same POV and short history of editing.  

Please explain what makes you think that  is a sockpuppet? Can you cite these actions of VinnyCee that are considered to be those of a sock-puppet?  

 I just did. It turns out that Vinny Cee is not a sockpuppet (at least, of anything we checked), but there was good reason to suspect she was.  

So VinnyCee is not'' a sock puppet. This means that Nescio's accusation of him being a sock puppet is false. Did you """"check"""" into whether the other accusations made by Nescio against other users are also false? I would bet that they are.  

It seems that you harass anyone who attempts to edit the Police state article without your viewpoint. This is against [[WP:NP",0,0,0,0,0,0

 sockpuppets on Physician

Thank you for reverting these edits.

I don' know why, but this article attracts lots of anonymous editors who like to delete without any explanation. I have asked a sysop (User:Shii) to semiprotect the article  he did this a month ago.

About 15 kilobytes (3/7 of the then total), including 2 large subsections, kept on being deleted by an apparent User:Nq0x77. One of the subsections (Other designations) has been in the article largely unchanged for well over a year; the wording here was earlier the subject of much discussion & editing because it concerned potentially controversial matters, but this was apparently resolved. When I tried Nq0x77's page to ask why, there was'nt one! No explanation of why the deletions are wise is shown on the Talk page. I've restored the article to the version left by User:Cubs197 earlier today, and you restored a further revert. The article has (or had)reached B class status, and is rated as top-importance, so I suggest major edits may merit at least some discussion, and I couldn't do this because User:Nq0x77 doesn't seem to be available.

 User:Shii wrote to me: just blocked the sockpuppet instead.  (tock) , and I have just replied: Thank you very much but, sadly, I think the same person is at it again, this time using a new and different sockpuppet (User: Pednursing ?), who has just made the same ~15kb deletion. Would semi-protect status stop this, or at least make it harder for him/her/it?

In case you can't see the very obvious joke or you don't live in Australia here's a brief background which I have to spoonfeed.

In fact for one of his segments, he reported that he edited Jimbo's user page (or article?) to say that he was a teenage drug lord from Malaysia.

Who said 'vandals' can't be respectable? Geez lighten up a bit, if you haven't seen the video Jimbo clearly took the idea of being a 'teenage Malaysian drug lord' quite well.

Elen, thank you for proving my point.  Meant seriously in saying so.  And no, I am not finished.

1, if Wikipedia is not a publisher of THE TRUTH (TM), it cannot then call itself an encyclopedia (Pillar #1).  It can, at best, and using your own definition here, Elen, be a publicly-accepted repository of publicly-accepted """"facts"""" accepted by the public.  I said that three times to make a point.  The repository is only made by publicly-accepted parties, the facts are also only those the collective shall accept, and the amount of verification is similar.

I point to the Wrestlemania XXVIII dispute.  This user has decided to use wikia-level """"evidence"""", but, since the public has accepted his stand, I am not allowed to challenge it.  And he's lying on top of it!  And if that, and other places I've attempted to edit, are any indication, this kind of conduct probably goes on all over the site!

The problem with the """"sports organization"""" (the BCS case) is that if that organization has removed the valid sanction of an event, then it creates an inconsistency between verifiability and damnatio memoriae.  If Wikipedia fancies itself an encyclopedia, then, it grants a sanction which no longer exists  in fact, it basically grants a status of """"fact"""" to something now ruled complete fiction due to the misconduct of one of the teams involved!  (And solely because the public accepts it.)  The problem comes in that Wikipedia, as an encyclopedia (and I will call this site on that again and again), grants a statement of """"fact"""" on something which is now fiction, because the public has decided that the event, since it physically took place, cannot be reversed, even if all evidence points to the fact that it should've been.

(And, yes, I will find the same farcical situation in many sports articles.)

And if I must find a """"published fact"""" for something, then personal knowledge becomes irrelevant to the process.  (The Final Fantasy case.)  If we are not going to trust the general public to do research (WP:OR), how do we trust the general public not to manipulate the """"published facts"""" (which see Mania XXVIII)?  Personally, speaking generally, I don't trust most members of the public (far beyond Wikipedia) to spell """"CAT"""" if they are spotted the """"C"""" and the """"A"""".  How am I going to trust them with a public repository of the """"facts"""" when they get to determine what is """"fact"""" and who gets to post it?  (Throwing out Pillar #2)

Ah, needs to be something the lawyer has signed.  I assert that hasn't happened in Cena-Rock, myself.  (One of my (ignored) claims was that the level of """"promo"""" of that match is the same as the level of promo in the Daniel Bryan intended-cash-in!)

And in stating """"These are some of our rules"""", you openly abdicate Pillar #5 by your own statement.  The choice is yours, not mine, because the public apparently gets to determine everything in Wikipedia as I said above.  How can I carry on an intelligent and informed conversation with someone like ChristianandJericho, who basically does not know proper English and chooses to type like a 12 year-old girl into a cellphone?  He probably doesn't even understand what I'm saying to him, frankly!  And how can I come to a consensus with a group of people like-minded to that?

At minimum, it's going to take a TBAN on pro wrestling and at least two IBANs on the two other users, for starters.  I can probably come up with at least a PBAN on a celebrity for a prosecuted 1998 criminal threat on top of it without even taking initial action on the page!    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Lana and Stephanie McMahon should stay in the main roster.

Lana is clearly feuding with Summer Rae, and everything is setting up for them to wrestle each other in either a singles or mixed tag match (with Ziggler and Rusev).

Stephanie is in the HHH category of saving his bullets for major feuds and angles, as she has wrestled the Bellas (with that feud main eventing Raw a couple of times last year), and has some business with Rhonda Rousey - which was set up last year at WrestleMania, and is rumored to culminate this year at Mania.

This is something relatively new in wrestling, where WWE is using people like Brock, Taker, Rock, Sting, HHH, and Stephanie in spurts for feuds leading up to major shows, then they disappear/fade into the background for awhile, and then they come back for their next feud/match, and so on, and so on.

If they didn't play for any country they can be considered according to where they played most of their career, where they have lived most of their lives,  what citizenship they possess or really according to what answer they gave in interviews to question if they rather feel being Canadians, Americans or Russians...  
 
This is very important because Slovaks are not Czechs, Canadians are not Americans, Latvians are not Russians.

Israeli-Palestinian conflict

On the talk page for """"List of massacres committed during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war"""", you state:

""""This is the truth believe it or not. The zionists gangs came to Palestine with a main task to accomplish: to evacuate the civilians houses and replace its inhabitants with jewish immigrants from europe and russia. And they did it the Machialivic way. Committing massacres to terrotrise and force palestinians to leave. Read more from unbiased resources on history for your convenience.""""

You seem to be forgetting the dozens of massacres committed against jews by palestinian arabs during the time that the British had control of palestine, from the early 19th century all the way up to the arab-israeli civil war. It is amazing that you anti-zionists can ever claim that 1: arabs were there first (lie: jews can be traced in the land back to 2000 B.C, with a civilization established around 1100 B.C, palestinians are just arabs who were dropped off by invading muslims in the mid 7th century A.D. Thats about 2500 years after the jews) and that the jews started killing palestinians for no reason (lie: during the civil war the massacres committed by jews were a response to both recent and continuing decades of violence and racism against jews. while Irgun and others who committed massacres were terrorists and shouldnt have killed civilians, they were provoked many times over by arabs.) Also, the Jews stopped deliberately targeting civilians half a century ago; Palestinians still do today.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Links to the authorative websites for the councils is appropriate. See Crater Lake link is allowed but Oregon Pacific, Cascade Pacific, Blue Mountain, etc are not?  Oregon Council links are not allowed but California is?

Information by district corrections were removed? . . the correct information was updated from the authorive websites of the Councils.  Do you not check the information before you delete or correct?

 outline articles 

I read your posts about outlines on AnnaFrance's talk page and decided to call the military history project for help in establishing guidance and providing review processes where editors can get outside opinion. The thread can be found here. Greetings   

Historical outlines
Regarding Category:Historical outlines...

I still strongly believe those """"Historical outline of foo"""" articles should actually be named """"Timeline of foo"""". More accurate and precise, and perhaps comprehensible. (I mentioned it before somewhere, but can't find it now).

For an example, compare Outline of Illinois history with Timeline of Chicago history.

Maybe we need to upgrade List of timelines to be a part of the Portal:Contents/ set?

Just a note, for you to consider, whilst you're mass-moving things around... )    

 Based on the way the history section of outlines have been developed (especially the history sections of country outlines), the major classification scheme seems to be:

 By period
 By region
 By subject

 Which makes these articles general outlines, rather than timelines.  The """"By period"""" section may be a timeline, if it is formatted that way.

 As far as I can tell, the """"historical outline of"""" articles by Buaidh aren't chronological, but topical, which makes them generic outlines rather than outlines of the timeline variety.

Tips on vandalizing this article

The best way to complain about a nonexistent, vague plan to do something you can't define is to post your boring opinions on Wikipedia. It doesn't matter that the existence of any """"North American currency union"""" is part of a larger insane conspiracy theory involving Jews, aliens, and Bush doing WTCgo ahead and have a furious debate about something imaginary, muck like two nerds standing outside a comic book store arguing about whether the Hulk can beat up Superman. Under no circumstances should you worry about the war in Iraq, the repressive enforcement of American drug laws, cronyism in the Justice Department, or discrimination against homosexuals in marriage lawsissues with actual relevance to justice and prosperity in America have no place in Fictitious Debate Land. It's important that the people who obsess enough about politics to put unreadable chunks of diarrhea into Wikipedia articles about their pet political theories be the most uninformed and uninsightful people in the world regarding actual political issues.

In all seriousness: there is no North American currency union, there is no plan to create one, the only place it exists is in science fiction. It is unworthy of an article at all, and having one just shows how far Wikipedia is gone into the thrall of conspiracy theorists and obsessive autistic nerds who can't figure out what is and is not important.

I'll clear the air here before I continue upon the current situation. 

I feel like I am being painted as the bad guy here, and that my editing and/or the editing of others is considered to be an American POV. I quote 

 Yet it was apparently Americans who started this article.

For the record. Yes I started this article. No I am not American. Such accusations that I am American and therefore my stance at maintaining the American ratings is of a POV nature are not only unfounded but unfair.

Secondly in regards to the link and image. This is no place to discuss such an issue here to begin with, and bringing it up in this situation is simply adding fuel to the fire. Furthermore it is simply a slap in the face given that just hours prior to your post I had re-opened dialogue asking for help choosing 1 of 4 new images for the infobox located here: Talk:Rookie Blue#New_Image. Since you have brought this up I have no choice but to defend myself and the editors involved about violations of NPOV. The items in question were added in this edit:  at 23:08, 17 May 2010. At the time of the edit the only available material was from the ABC. I refer you to the following two links. The first will show that the ABC Rookie Blue website was indexed on the 28 Apr 2010. The second link will show that the GlobalTV Rookie Blue website was indexed on the 12 Jun 2010. Hell I will even used google.ca:

ABC:
http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&lr;=&tbs;=qdr%3Ay&q;=%22http%3A%2F%2Fabc.go.com%2Fshows%2Frookie-blue%22&aq;=f&aqi;=&aql;=&oq;=&gs;_rfai=

Global:
http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&lr;=&tbs;=qdr%3Ay&q;=%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.globaltv.com%2Frookieblue%2Findex.html%22&aq;=f&aqi;=&aql;=&oq;=&gs;_rfai=

As you can see Logical_Fuzz did no wrong as the material from Global was not available to him/her till nearly a month later. As far as I know Logical_Fuzz is in the North American region. Specifically what nationality I am unsure of, but his/her edits were made in good faith and not in an American POV. Any further allegations that state me or other editors that have contributed to this article or the main article have violated NPOV, without proper proof backing those allegations; will not be met with too kindly.

Third. I was the one who added that is was a Canadian police drama (evidence here: ) as I accept it is a mainly a Canadian production. If I wanted to I could easily say it was a Canadian-American production. This should further dispel any such allegations that I am in violation of NPOV.

Now on with what I am to say. As I said I accept that this is mainly a Canadian Production. The page says Canadian but it also says the following:

 The series is a joint venture between Canwest Broadcasting and ABC, and produced by E1 Entertainment.

Given that Canwest also put out a joint announcement with the ABC () renewing Rookie Blue for a second season, I think it is fair to say a joint venture doesn't mean that anything American immediately takes a back seat. In regards to the """"Do not add foreign broadcasters here"""" comment. I am confused. Are you suggesting we remove the ABC as the original channel? Or have you just read it wrong and trying to argue that the picture and website don't below because it says """"Do not add foreign broadcasters here""""?

Read the first sentence of this whole exchange.

""""I do not have a problem with adding Canadian Ratings to the table but here are my concerns"""" 

I respectfully decline to participate in the MOS discussion for now.

 Thoughts on Editing war 

In all honest Caleb, I feel your argument is valid. As an outsider that just started reading Seth Speaks mid last year. I did my own research on this topic to seeing a big difference in how it currently being presented. Have you tried contacting the people directly associated with the book? I feel that Wikipedia administratration is being unfair to Celeb. With lack of sensiblity and respect of his efforts to express the works of actual writers and editors in a domain he isn't familiar with. I made an account just so I express my words of gratitude for your efforts Caleb of preserving the message of this topic in an unbiased way! Don't give up, for the people directly invovle with this topic will side with you...Took me a while to figure this out ) 
  

 FYI, Caleb is topic banned from this article. As to """"side with you"""", be very careful about siding with Caleb. He has violated a number of policies during his efforts to protect this subject and even got blocked. He was unblocked only after promising not to edit this article. You should also read about meatpuppetry: """"A new user who engages in the same behavior as another user in the same context, and who appears to be editing Wikipedia solely for that purpose, may be subject to the remedies applied to the user whose behavior they are joining."""" If your behavior becomes too similar to his, the duck test may apply. It hasn't yet, and I'm hoping to save you trouble.

 I am providing this advice to save to from running into the same problems which have hounded his editing. I'll leave a welcome template on your talk page. It contains links to our policies and guidelines. Please read them. Good luck here. BTW, this also applies to the Jane Roberts article.

 Rostling 

Rostling is a alternative form of wrestling, a form of """"Worshiping God"""".  Normally done at small groups, there is always an entertaining match.  The reason it is played in small groups is due to the indisputable fact that it was invented in one of the these such meetings.  Bronski Wookie (name changed for security purposes), is credited with the invention of this game.  There are two judges, both decide the weight classes.  If there is a tie, then the judges decide who is the winner.  The game itself is like wrestling, but it allows a formerly banned hold: the behind-the-head choke hold.  Once in this hold, if held long enough and done right, the captive is forced to tap out due to lack of oxygen.  The rostler most known for this hold is named Justin Bieber.  No, not the girl, the rostler.  Never heard of him?  He often wins his matches by properly executing the choke hold.  
 To play the game 
 1. Both contestants start at opposite sides of the rink.  The judges announce their names, like """"White Bread"""" or """"Whole Wheat""""
 2. The judge starts the countdown, and the two contestants begin to rostle.
 3. A combination of moves are necessary to be effective in this sport, and there are two ways to do it. Finesse or power.  In finesse, one must use many holds and twists.  If one is quick, it greatly increases the chance of success in the match.  In power, one often uses his strength to throw his opponent to the ground.  Both techniques are very effective.  No punching or kicking is allowed
 4. The way to win is to force the opponent to tap out.  There are many ways to do this, the main point is to tire him out, or use the choke hold.
 5. Once the match is finished, the winner is announced by the judges, and they are congratulated.

That, is how you play a match of rostling.

 Mughals 

Claiming that the Mughals were a Turkic people, and mentioning some odd Turkish name given to them (a name that does not appear in ANY historical or scholarly sources), is pure POV. 

The Mughals were neither Turks in ethnicity (they were originally Mongols, descening from the Timurid and other Chingizid families of Central Asia > Berlas Mongols), nor in language (starting with Humayun, they were certainly and evidently Persian-speakers; Akbar did not even know Chaghatay - he had to translate his grandfather's memos into Persian to read them! Later, the Mughals were evidently Urdu speaking!)

I do not know why certain users keep putting that POV paragraph into the article. They claim that it is sourced ... but not all sources are good. Why do they ignore the whole bunch of other, mostly authoritative sources (such as the works of Prof. B.F. Manz, THE leading expert on Timurid and Turco-Mongol history; see: B.F. Manz, """"Tīmūr Lang"""", in Encyclopaedia of Islam, Online Edition, 2006)?! They only stick to certain versions of the Britannica ... only those that suite them. They totally ignore other sections of Britannica that actually have a totally different opinion on the isse. For example this one:

""""... Baber: The first Mughal, or Mongol, emperor of India (1526–30) and founder of the Mughal Dynasty there was Baber. He also won distinction as a military commander, a gifted poet and diarist, a statesman, and an adventurer. As ruler of the principality of Fergana in Turkestan, his birthplace, Baber first tried to recover Samarkand, the former capital of the empire founded by his Mongol ancestor Timur Lang ..."""" 

The Columbia Encyclopaedia states:

''""""... Timur (timoor') or Tamerlane (tăm'urlān), c.1336–1405, Mongol conqueror, b. Kesh, near Samarkand. ..."""" 

The paragraph about the Mughals should be removed. Even IF some people believe that they should be listed, only because their FIRST ruler (Babur) wrote his memoires in Turkic, the paragraph should be removed because it's controversial. Memoires do not prove anything, especially in regard of the fact that Humayun's biography is written in Persian (by his sister Gulbadan Begum), and that Shah Bahadur II is known as one of the greatest Urdu poets!

Ok, and after this here is now the detailled technical explanation and conclusive evidence for the UE categories and their achievable throughput: The calculation of the theoretical DL throughput in MBit/s according to the largest available carrier bandwidth of 20 MHz  is as follows: A 20 MHz carrier consists of 100 Ressource Blocks (RB). Each RB consists of 12 Subcarriers (SC), which can be divided into 2 time slots (TS) each that carry 7 ODFM-Symbols each. Further we have a QAM modulation scheme. The maximum QAM specified is 64QAM, which means there are 6 bits/symbol. Additionally we have 2x2 MIMO antenna technology which allows two parallel data layers (L). In total this results in: 100 RB * 12 SC * 2 TS * 7 ODFM-Symbols * 6 bit/Symbol * 2 L = 201,6 MBit/s (Absolute theoretical technical maximum DL data rate per 20 MHz carrier). [] (page 3).
Now let's take a look at the UE categories. This information derives from the specification document 3GPP TS 36.213 [] (page 25 to 34): Let's take a look at table 7.1.7.1-1:
Cat 4 Devices use coding scheme MCS28 for DL and MCS23 for UL. This leads to TBS Index 26 for DL and 21 for UL. Looking at table 7.1.7.2.1 we now look at N_PRB (# of Ressource Blocks) = 100 (corresponds to 20 MHz carrier). For the TCS indices above we find 75376 and 51024 respectively. This results in 51,024 MBit/s for the UL. For the downlink we have 2x2 MIMO, so there are 2 Layers. Corresponding to table 7.1.7.2.2: The available number of ressource blocks 75376 (SISO) translates to 149776 for 2x2 MIMO resulting in 149,776 MBit/s ~ 150 MBit/s. As can be seen this ist a bit less than the 2*75,376=150,752 MBit/s which are stated in the 3GPP UE table Table 4.1-1 in TS 36.306.
Cat 3 Devices use coding scheme MCS23 for DL and UL. So with the explanation above we find: 51024 resulting in 51,024 MBit/s for UL again and with 2x2 MIMO for DL 101,8 MBit/s or simply 2*51,024=102,048 MBit/s (Table 4.1-1 in TS 36.306).
If we now reduce the carrier block size to 10 MHz - what happens? The amount of ressource blocks reduces from 100 to 50 - that's all. The MCS coding scheme stays the same. The conclusion is that a Cat4 device is able to achieve a theoretical troughput of 73,712 MBit/s with 10 MHz (50 RB) (Tables 7.1.7.2.1 & 7.1.7.2.2) of spectrum. Subsequently a Cat3 device in contrast can only reach 50,024 MBit/s according to these two tables and not around 75 MBit/s as previously discussed. I hope this clarified the issue so far. I doubt, that the development group is wrong here in their own specification.   20:26",0,0,0,0,0,0

There is a common pratice by American television to label events as if it were a television programme.

 Smears 

Hi Turqoise127

A number of your recent edits (the AfD for Boba Phat, Cyclopia's talk page) state or imply the existence of editors ganging up to game Wikipedia's processes, and further imply the inappropriateness of such. 

First, if you want to talk about inappropriate ganging up, you should be aware of a formal body that exists in practice almost solely to vote in blocs against deletion. The Article Rescue Squadron works by tagging articles with a template, so that other editors are alerted to the existence of a speedy, prod, or AfD nomination. The usual result is vote packing at AfD discussions without improvement to articles (the nominal goal of the squadron). This leads to far more """"unfair advantage"""" by virtue of """"block votes"""" and """"sway[ing of] opinion"""" than a few editors who occasionally show up at the same AfD discussions. 

Here's the great thing about AfD discussions. Anyone (except sock puppets and blocked users) can show up and opine. All someone needs to do is go to Wikipedia:Articles for deletion#Current discussions and start browsing. You may think that when a number of editors show up opining """"delete"""" for an article, and none on the other side show up to opine """"keep"""", it's an indication of unfair voting blocs. But in fact, it generally indicates that:
 editors who have a predilection to stringent interpretation of WP:N agree it's not notable;
 middle-of-the-road editors agree it's not notable; and
 editors who have a predilection to a lenient interpretation of WP:N either believe in their hearts that it's a clear-cut case, or realize that the obvious weight of the consensusnotwithstanding their disagreementmakes it not worthwhile to bother opining. 

The same occurs where """"keep"""" is either obvious to all, or so widely supported that editors with limited time don't bother to tilt at windmills. I don't know how other editors do it, but when I browse through AfD discussions, I tend not to bother with snowball cases in either direction unless I have some knowledge of the subject or believe an important principle is being illustrated. 

In any event, your continued smear campaign against """"certain groups"""" as """"plainly unfair"""" is against policy and has become more than tiresome. Cut it out. 

Bongomatic 

Hi Bongomatic, it is flattering how you stalk me and react to every single contribution I make. However I think you are over-reacting a bit. I mentioned no names in any of my comments; they were general. If expressing my views on certain events that I witness is against policy, please tell me how so, because it reaks of censorship. I do stand by my views, I think you know that. And even though I like and respect you, I am not really looking for friends here. Your article rescue squadron comment and illustration is definitely a valid point, but you must take into account that they (squadron) are reactionary, so they (at least I think, could be wrong) react to deletionist strong-arming of marginal or worthy articles that really could/should be kept. Be that as it may, if you ever feel something I do is against policy, do what you gotta do, caus I will not be changing anytime soon. I am still looking at my options regarding my issues; do nothing and attempt to soften influence with my presence on here, write essays, discuss at water pump, arb com, whatever. I don't know enough about Wiki yet. I will learn though...

 I know. The problem is that many editors involved are already tired of this dispute and would rather stay clear of it. That is the only reason we all started making compromises, including myself. Normally, I would have taken the initiative and opened an RFC. But since majority of the editors have voiced their intention to settle for a compromise (and most have even moved on from the dispute for good), I think it's up to the editor that refuses to accept this compromise to take the necessary action.

El Nino

The (limited and perhaps maladroit) changes I've made in the first bit of the article (ignoring, please, my snide comment), you may give a sense of where jargon might impede readability of the article.

However, could be a case in which """"if you have to ask"""" then maybe you can't help, or maybe you can.

I've added article to """"watch list"""" for the moment, and may try to marginally contribute. I don't pretend to understand subject with slightest depth, and would be cautious.

The larger problem is in its organization. 

A general reader wants to know, immediately, what are the potential consequences of El Nino. Instead, the article's lead grafs launch  into a long-winded and seemingly vague description of its history and theory that are more appropriate for deep into its body.

 What is the relevancy of his ethnicity? 
His mixture of ethnicity's is very American common bringing in the curious """"everyman"""" theme that is so quintessentially American.  This has intrigue for readers who, just as the experts, are trying to puzzle out just what drove this person to do what he did.  Astute readers are going to want to sift every clue available to them as their desire to correctly understand his motives, his personality drives their efforts.  To simply gloss over and erase out information to make him appear ethnically neutral would be both dishonest and a disservice to readers putting in some real effort to understand him. Trying to understand a serial killer, and the social fabric they navigate through is complex as it gets and any clues are appreciated.  

Is it relevant to mention he was of Italian and Filipino descent?  He was born in California which makes him American. 
His looks were such that he tended to blend in everywhere and anywhere, so yes, it is relevant.  
However, feel free to move that information deeper into the article.  
I don't understand how readers are supposed to draw the conclusion that being of Italian/ Filipino descent makes it easier to blend in.  The way the information is presented seems to form an impression that his ethnicity had something to do with his criminal actions.  My conclusion is that it is irrelevant and should be deleted. 
No, it made it easier for him to blend in in Miami.  
The following section, """"Since he was of mixed race (his mother was white, and his father, Filipino), he blended in well in the diverse Miami Beach scene"""", all looks to me like original research.  Are there any references to support that this is a published conclusion?   
Just to clarify, I don't mean the part about his parents ethnicity in and of itself (that is documented), I'm referring to the idea that it had some special advantage which helped him fit in.  From my readings on this subject his ability to fit into the Miami scene was due to his gay lifestyle more than any other factor.

Hello ChrisScorsese88, and welcome to Wikipedia. Your addition to List of Jessie episodes has had to be removed, as it appears to have added copyrighted material without permission from the copyright holder. While we appreciate your contributing to Wikipedia, there are certain things you must keep in mind about using information from your sources to avoid copyright or plagiarism issues here.

You can only copy/translate a small amount of a source, and you must mark what you take as a direct quotation with double quotation marks ("""") and a cited source. You can read about this at Wikipedia:Non-free content in the sections on """"text"""". See also Wikipedia:Referencing for beginners, for how to cite sources here.
Aside from limited quotation, you must put all information in your own words and structure, in proper paraphrase. Following the source's words too closely can create copyright problems, so it is not permitted here; see Wikipedia:Close paraphrasing. (There is a college-level introduction to paraphrase, with examples, hosted by the Online Writing Lab of Purdue.) Even when using your own words, you are still, however, asked to cite your sources to verify information and to demonstrate that the content is not original research. 
Our primary policy on using copyrighted content is Wikipedia:Copyrights. You may also want to review Wikipedia:Copy-paste. 
In very rare cases (that is, for sources that are public domain or compatibly licensed), it may be possible to include greater portions of a source text. However, please seek help at the help desk before adding such content to the article. 99.9% of sources may not be added in this way, so it is necessary to seek confirmation first. If you do confirm that a source is public domain or compatibly licensed, you will still need to provide full attribution; see Wikipedia:Plagiarism for the steps you need to follow.
Also note that Wikipedia articles may not be copied without attribution. If you want to copy from another Wikipedia project or article, you can, but please follow the steps in Wikipedia:Copying within Wikipedia.

To answer  and in doing so  as well, I do not take to gaming Wikipedia lightly.  Especially when I find myself involved with those editors doing so? Who's gaming wikipedia? Firstly; Arthur Rubin. Have you looked at the laundry list of violations this """"admin."""" has racked up? Deleting other users posts on talk pages, tag team reverting, blocking, edit warring, being blocked etc. etc. etc. A short review of the section on my talk, brought to me by an IP editor too afraid to use their actual user-account informed me of his nefarious record here on Wikipedia. I refuse to walk into a known hostile article with hostile editors waiting to pounce like Subject Trolls. Who set this precedent of a hostile editing environment? Arthur Rubin, whose repeated rule-busting and counter-productive, antagonistic dancing around the issues leads only to toxic situations like this. I am NOT a push-over. Further, the editors in question,  and  make zero suggestions or concessions, oh but the """"undo"""" button never fails to escape their attention.  How many times do I have to say this? These editors have the same stone-wall tactics and bad attitudes responsible for the grid lock in Washington D.C. where only the people/Wikipeia viewer are/is made to suffer. This is why, people like Arthur Rubin should not be a Wikipedia admin., this is why people like Arthur Rubin should not even so much as be Wikipedians. As of now, I will be writing an email to Wikipedia management and demanding his permanent dismissal and subsequent blocking of his most used IP. By the way, it has not escaped me that you haven't made one mention of the inability of either  or  violations of Common Sense or Wikipedia:Assume good faith cornerstones.

My concern is that an entire article on Billy the Kid was removed for no valid reason. That article not only contained my contributions, but the contributions of others. It contained the most detailed bibliography on Billy the Kid offered yet on Wikepedia. It also included 147 detailed citations. There is no valid excuse for removing that article and substituting the mess that is there now. Blocking me for real or imagined infractions is one thing. Destroying the article that I, and others, had worked long and hard on - and replacing it with an absolute piece of junk - is quite another. You have done extensive work on Wikipedia's Wyatt Earp article. How would you feel if all of your efforts were deleted? What was done to my last version of the Billy Kid article is nothing less than criminal - and that crime is against Wikipedia and all of those unselfish people who have tried to make it a reliable source. The joke is, I considered myself finished with the Billy the Kid article when it was suddenly removed. Now if you, and the others at Wikipedia """"sincerely value your expertise. Wikipedia needs knowledgeable authors like you,"""" as you say. You will restore my last version of the article. Here is my good faith offer: If Wikipedia will restore that article at the point where I last left it, I promise that I will not go near it again. I look forward to the work that your expert editors can do to correct the """"encyclopedic tone,"""" and encourage that effort. I also look forward to submissions and improvements to this article by other Wikipedians. Please note that I have claimed to """"own"""" the Billy the Kid article. All I was trying to do was to provide the most accurate template on the subject of Billy the Kid that others could work from. The quickest way to do this is restore the article as it was when it was moved. I have no intention of trying to get it back to that point, by correcting the absolute mess that is up there right now. I trust you and all the forthright editors at Wikipedia to correct the """"encyclopedic tone"""" that you consider lacking. I would also appreciate the removal of those tags that have suddenly appeared at the top of articles I contributed to on Bat Masterson and Luke Short. They suddenly appeared on the Masterson and Short articles at the exact same time my last version of Billy the Kid. It is not that I should be treated differently because of my credentials in the Wild West History field ... the fact is that no one should have to be treated that way. This is childish behavior from those who don't have the best interest of Wikipedia involved. I won't bother asking to be unblocked ( which, of course, I should be ) since I have to leave the clowns that put that block in place something they can brag about ... as in the vein of """"Well, I guess we showed him!"""" Now the time has come to show everyone else what Wikipedia really stands for. The place to start is with your good faith restoration of my Billy the Kid article exactly as it was when I last worked on it. Unless I am specifically asked for clarification, on some historical point on the Kid,by you, and others involved with Wikipedia, I have absolutely no intention of doing anything further on the subject of Billy the Kid. My best wishes to you and all of those who labor so hard at making Wikipedia great. Happy holidays to you all ... you already know what I want for Christmas as far as Wikipedia is concerned.

97d5035a880aa780,"Twisted Facts

1. Wal-Mart does not spend as much on insurance as other companies.

The fact. Yes Wal-Mart spends less per work for health.

The Twist. What they forget to say is that Wal-Mart does not buy insurance at 
all, it puts that money into a bank account, where it collects interest, it then contracts Blue Cross to admin the fund. 

The reality. Wal-Mart gives better insurance than most other retailers. 
Want to see for yourself go to your local walmart and get an assocate guide.

2. Wal-Mart does not supply as many with healthcare.

The fact. Yes on a percentage base Wal-Mart only 47% are covered.

The Twist. What critics don't tell you is that Wal-Mart offers Star Bridge health from day one, and that wal-mart has 1.6 million Workers with a larger turn over rate, so this leads to a lower percentage of works covered.

3. Wal-Mart has a high turn over rate.

The Fact. Wal-Mart does have a high turn over rate.

The Twist. Critics Site Wal-Mart as the reason, however most of people that leave walmart site customer related stress. And the area of walmart that has the highest turn over is also the largest pool of workers, cashiers. Plain and simple the customers run the cashiers out. And who can blame them think of all the people in the world you could not stand, and they deal with them all everyday.

4. Wal-Mart has more workers on state healthcare than any other company.

The Fact. Yes wal-mart does have more works on state healthcare.

The Twist. Critics argue that due to the number of workers on state healthcare is single handedly causing problems for many state healthcare,however what they forget to say is that Walmart pays 70 Billion dollars in federal taxes and nearly that again in state taxes and also generate billions of dollars in sales tax for each state with sales tax,which far out does the money spend buy the state on healthcare for wal-mart assocates. And many of the assocates that quilify for state aided healthcare also would quailify for welfare if they did not work for walmart. And would most likely be on both if they worked for a smaller ma and pa shop, that could not afford to supply any benefits. 

5. Wal-mart buys large quantities from china

The Fact Yes walmart buys a lot from china.

The Twist Critics argue that Walmart alone is the primary reason for US jobs being exported, however what they fail to say is that walmart is only 8% of the use Retail market, and 70% of walmarts income if from food sales and 90% of walmarts food supply comes from local and national suppliers, like con-agra. When broken down walmart sends a mear penny to china out of ever transaction. something much larger than walmart is helping china out. 

Now these are just 5 of the biggest twisted facts, there are many more out there, both good and bad for walmart, walmart does its share of fact twisting too. However I have seen almost no hard research here on any of the facts being relied on. I have alot of hard proof of lots of these twisted facts but I can not be the only one out looking for the twistes in the facts. And I also am not going to post any of the proofs until others start, because I want everyone here to start doing some research and finding some real reliable facts that we can bring this entry back to a good standing. But we must work together to do that, not against eachother. The Ace!",0,0,0,0,0,0

The FIDESZ-MPP are nationalists, and very likely ultra-nationalists. Why? First of all, a number of mass media articles and other coverage, both domestic (Hungarian) and foreign, have concluded, based on their actions, statements, rallies, and their own admission, that they are nationalists or ultra-nationalists. Something I witnessed in Budapest during the elections in 2002: FIDESZ-MPSZ (the part after the hyphen has changed over and over) told their voters, most of whom do not deny being nationalists, to wear the national colors pin, or cocard, and carry Hungarian flags during the elections, at all times if possible, to show that they are true, patriotic Hungarians, unlike the MSZP and their junior SZDSZ, who, acccording to FIDESZ, are traitors of the nation!!! Of the total Hungarian voting population at least 50% of them favor MSZP, SZDSZ, and an assortium of other progressive parties or the relatively moderate MDF! In fact, Mrs. Ibolya David, head of the MDF (Magyar Demokrata Forum) broke up with Mr. Viktor Orban and have since been bitter rivals for the affections of the right-wing voters!!! Anyway, I will not put the term """"nationalists"""" or """"ultra-nationalists"""" myself, since I was the first to notice the ommission, but I strongly suggest it should be done for historic accuracy's sake. FIDESZ-MPP are more like Austrian Jorg Haider's Freedom Party than Wolfgang Schussel's Conservative Party.

 Why ref to AP arch. inscriptions and valuable historical books removed 

Dear Sitush,

You have asked about the independence of """"Andhra Kshatriyas History by Pencommunities.matsa Krishnam Raju, Kshatriya vamsa ratnamala""""
earlier in this talk page. Its strange how you follow a different standard when it comes to Kammas page where you have vilified a caste book (Kammavari charitra by KB Chowdary) which is more of a Caste book rather an independent author, as it is 
written by A kamma on Kamma caste.
I may not be a full timed wiki author/ contributor like you, but I do follow same rules for all wiki pages and communities. my only concern is you have been following double standards in Kamma page may be its your community.

Apart from Andhra Kshatriyas History book,
you have also removed content which had AP archaelogical inscription sentences (http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume10/kakatiya_dynasty_1.html) and 
sentences from Pg 174 The History of Andhra Country, Yashoda Devi.

As you are the author for Kammas page plz be reminded that same rules apply for all pages, if some caste book can be taken as reference/citation, then can every other community can refer ther own community history books.
I request you to be fair to other communities also.

Hereby i am providing some valuable citations, others will be followed soon.

Well, you're claims were pretty outlandish, but I'm willing to assume good intentions. On Wikipedia, anything that's likely to be challenged must be cited. I know you cited it, but you can't use other Wikipedia articles to cite information. You have to use reliable and independent sources to cite any information you add to articles. 

To review: (1) Anything that's likely to be challenged by a reasonable individual must be referenced (here is some potentially useful info on referencing) (2) References must be from reliable sources (i.e. books by respectable individuals/publishers; news articles, etc.) that are neutral and independent from the topic. (they do not have some type of vested interest in pushing any particular point of view) (3) You cannot use another Wikipedia article as a source. 

Wikipedia is always looking for editors interested in making this place better. If you want to join, great!

Advice
To save me writing too much, a lot of this is going to be links to existing policies and guidelines - there is plenty of advice available, in fact a confusing amount, so pointers may be helpful. The guide to writing Your First Article and the Business' FAQ are particularly useful.

Wikipedia frowns on writing about your own organisation because of worries that someone with a conflict of interest will not be able to write from the Neutral Point of View which is one of our three key content policies. (The others are Verifiability and No Original Research). However, the anonymity of account names means it can't be prohibited, and it may be better to have a declared interest than somone pushing a case anonymously.

It should be possible for you to write an article about your organisation that won't get deleted, if you are careful. The first essential is to avoid any hint of promotion - be drily factual, as though you were unconnected with the organisation and had no interest in it, but were documenting it for completeness. See the guideline on peacock terms.

The next point is likely to be the problem if your organisation is new - notability, which is the Wikipedia term for """"of enough general interest for an encyclopedia article"""". See the guidelines on Notability and Notability (organisations and companies). What you have to do is find references from reliable sources which are independent of you. Your own web-site etc are not considered independent. Has there been comment on your organisation, e.g. in the trade press? It may be that you will have to wait until you are more established and can cite independent references.

I wrote the above off-line: now that I come to post it, I see you have run into another problem - copyright. That's more of a problem than you might think, because everything in WP must released under the """"GFDL"""" which says that anyone may do anything with it including rework it for commercial use - so just saying """"I agree to this being put in"""" is not enough. The notice above tells you what you can do, but for the reasons in my third para above it is very likely that your mission statement will not be in suitable terms for Wikipedia, so the solution to the copyright problem may well be to rewrite it. That leads me to a last warning: an important difference between Wikipedia and a business directory is that you will not own your article - see WP:OWN - other people can and will edit it. See the warning at the bottom of the page you use to edit: """"If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed for profit by others, do not submit it.""""

Here, Toby72 asked me to take a look at this. Here is what I saw in a not-so quick look at recent edits.
This 14 April version of the article had an initial paragraph in the Colonia Era section which was largely unsupported.
In this 15 April edit, Toby72 replaced this paragraph with new content, still largely unsupported. The new content changed the focus of the paragraph, removing a heavy weight previously given to rape in a master/slave relationship in favor of heavier emphasis on mulatto offspring.
In this series of three April 15 edits, DD2K reintroduced the emphasis on rape, citing supporting sources.
In this 15 April edit, Tobby72 reverted the DD2K edits, saying """"WP is not a blog"""".
In this 17 April edit, Tobby72 added and rearranged some material.
In this 17 April edit, anon 69.105.28.149 reverted the article back to its state as of the last edit by DD2K, without explanation.
In this edit, apparently not noticing that the article had been anonymously reverted to one of his prevvious edit versions, DD2K made some further edits to the article, saying, """"Undid revision 550678046 by Tobby72 (talk)Not weighted properly. Vast majority of scholars(and obvious common sense) state slave/master 'relationsips' were rape by the very nature"""".
In this May 3 edit, Toby72 added and removed some material in this and other sections of the article. saying, """"readd quotes per WP:NPOV, plus add pics"""".
In this May 3 edit, DD2k reverted the prior edit by Tobby72, saying, """"...  rv- stop- If you want to make these kinds of controversial changes, use the Talk page.""""
In this May 3 edit, Toby72 added a  tag to the section.

I think I've got that straignt. Some of the edits mentioned above were separated from one another by unrelated edits made by other users.

Guys, please re-read WP:BRD. I know that it is an essay and not a policy, but it does describe a workable method for reaching consensus by identifying objections to edits and keeping discussion moving forward and help towards breaking deadlocks. That Bold-Revert-Discuss method is much superior to the Bold-Revert-Unrevert-Edit war method which has been tried here. Regardless of how the section at issue got to be in its current state, can we please have some discussion aimed at establishing a consensus about what it ought to contain?

It looks to me as if the main area of disagreement is how much weight should be given to information about master-slave rapes in colonial America in an article on the topic of Mulatto, which the lead sentence describes as, """"a term commonly used in the United States to refer to a person who is born from one white parent and one black parent, or more broadly, a person of any 'mixed' ancestry."""" Input from editors not involved in the edit-warish exchanges above would probably be useful. I'll mention that this source might be useful. It speaks somewhat to the subtopic at issue here, though not from an American Colonial Era viewpoint.   (talk) (earlier Boracay Bill) """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Fat is never converted to Glc, not at least in humans according to the textbooks.  

Let me add few things. First, Glc enters/leaves the cell through a proces called facilitated diffusion. Which means that as soon as the Glc concentration inside the cell is somehow increased, Glc will start leaving the cell - which by the way happens in hepatocytes during glycogenolysis. Second, even if there was a way to keep Glc inside the cell, say through active transport, Glc poses a danger to the cell integrity as Glc is a highly osmotically active compound. The cell solves these two issues with a single solution by synthesizing glycogen from Glc - the enormous glycogen molecules can't leave the cell, and by having osmotically inert glycogen instead of Glc, the cell avoids the osmotic shock.  13:55, 30",0,0,0,0,0,0

Obviously I disagree with the note about the photographs. The term """"graphic"""" tends to inappropriately stigmatize the nature of the photography. The photographas, are clinical and medical in nature. They are scientifically relevant and in no way should be associated with things like pornography or """"grpahic"""" sexuality that somme cultures consider inappropriate for some audience. Noting that they are Surgical photos makes their content emphatically clear for anyone who might not be emotionally or psychologically mature enough to view them. There are plenty of articles on wikipedia about medical issues, with photographs, that do not include any such warnings, e.g.:

 Breast_implant/Risks_and_debate

 Breast_implant

If you took the time to read the entirety of the information Anne Lawrence, MD provides on Dr. Metlzer's work and techniques, you will see that his origination of his techhniques and procedures are documented there. See also the referenced article by Takta, LL and Meltzer, TR, in pubmed. I believe this article is being held to a ridiculous and unfair standard, that is not representative of the wikipedia. I believe that the microscopic treatment this article has received is evidence of bias against its subject matter, while the simple fact is clear that this surgeon is referenced repeatedly in other wikipedia articles about related surgical topics. In  addition, the very nature of the subject matter should be protected a topic given the level of bigotry, discrimination, and violence including murder against people who receive these medical treatments. The very fact that a surgeon like Toby Meltzer, with such a prestigious medical background, chooses to concentrate on such service to other people, who have few if any equally qualified alternatives, is notable by itself, without need for any further citation. These surgeries are in and of themselves pioneering, and largely non-existent on any measurable scale before the 1960s. Even now, the number of frequent U.S. practitioners is few, including only Meltzer and Marci Bowers, MD (who was previously a patient of Meltzer!), on a truly regular basis.  19:29, 17 September 2006.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Dear , with all the good will I have for your inquiry for recommendations among Adam Thorpe's ouevre, I'm afraid I must disappoint you as I have virtually nothing to offer. The loss is mine as well: a trudge to the local library revealed its collection to hold precisely zero titles of his.

(Resource restrictions prevent me from acquiring books by choice; happily, I'm largely content to make do with what comes my way.) I was impressed with this collection of short stories, a favorite genre of mine, and likewise noted the author's recognition as a poet and dramatist. Imagine my indignation, then, to discover he had no page in the English-language Wikipedia! As with other authors I consider worthy of promotion, I took the time and made the effort to create a page with what I could find on the Web, and was gratified to subsequently it expanded by fellow editors.

This was reverted. When u use web news sites such as Tamilnet to esatblish facts outside of WP:SLR articles u will run into it. That's why I stay away from it as much as possible. You really do have to read WP rules very carefully such as WP:RS & WP:Verifiability. It says {[Quote|Articles should rely on reliable, third-party published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy.[4] Reliable sources are necessary both to substantiate material within articles and to give credit to authors and publishers in order to avoid plagiarism and copyright violations. Sources should directly support the information as it is presented in an article and should be appropriate to the claims made: exceptional claims require high-quality sources.

In general, the most reliable sources are peer-reviewed journals and books published in university presses; university-level textbooks; magazines, journals, and books published by respected publishing houses; and mainstream newspapers. As a rule of thumb, the greater the degree of scrutiny involved in checking facts, analyzing legal issues, and scrutinizing the evidence and arguments of a particular work, the more reliable it is.

Academic and peer-reviewed publications are highly valued and usually the most reliable sources in areas where they are available, such as history, medicine and science. Material from reliable non-academic sources may also be used in these areas, particularly if they are respected mainstream publications. The appropriateness of any source always depends on the context. Where there is disagreement between sources, their views should be clearly attributed in the text.}} That's why we use Tamilnet as a QS not RS. You have thousands of peer reviewed academic books to establish the same facts using google books. No one will fight you then.",0,0,0,0,0,0

childish redirect

(the article presently on the main Clairsentience page .. if it stays there for 5 minutes ... is the old first draft before months of work was childishly trashed and a meaningless redirect to the clairvoyance page put in its place... 

the playground games continue...

ive posted this on the clairvoyance talk page after someone completely removed the clar#irsentience article which had gone through a process of months of work , rewrites , endless discussion , removasl of personal matereal , edits for style and content .... endless work on correct sourcing and wikpedia referencing and formatting.....  the article which had been arrived at with co operation and discussion over many weeks and v man who himself put some hours into grammer , punctuation ... re editting for stlye and content ... and much help in correct sourcing and referencing  ..... 

this article was the sum  of many peoples input , effort and hard work  so i dont know how or who removed it so thoughtlessly and put the meaningless redirect to the clairvoyance page... any help would be great.... cheers.. 

hi guys

i see youve redirected  the clairsentience article.... let me ask....what was the point of the weeks of discussions and rewrites if you guys were going to redirect it anyway....you should have told me t get lost out of here...... what was the point of it all?  why did i listen to you ? at all?  why did i remove all personal references?  why did i reference and source all of my matereal diligently and in great detail ?  why did i edit and re edit for style and content ?  why did i make additional references to religios , anthropological ,socialogical , philosophical ,medical , physics , chemistry , botany , mental health etc  so that all views were included and respected?  why did i fulfill all of the above hurdles and hoops to fulfill wikpedia formatting and guidlines for you too to delete months of hard work and effort.  your actions are without integrity or honour .....
clairsentience article redirect ?

Hi ..... whoever removed the clairsentience article and made it redirect ... can you please try and respect that the article that was there had evolved over a couple of months of discussion and many rewrites and multiple edits which involved much discussion over a long period......
.........i could delete this clairvoyance article.... but i wont because revert and delete wars then stupidly take place   which is a real shame when a library becomes a bar room brawl......

..... i hope you can respect the clairsentience article...

..... ive been clairsentient for most of my adult life and it wasnt easy to come this far and to struggle for  decades to articulate my experience in a way which makes rational sense to the world at large of which the clairsentience article is a manifest example..... so please try and respect the vast amount of struggle and work which has gone into it....

Page protection
Keilana, can you please explain why you have semi protected the page Huma Abedin ? You have stated vandalism which is clearly not the case! Please see Biographies of living persons/Noticeboard where the matter is being dealt with ! Can you explain your actions ? I understand I am new here but it was one of the first pieces of information i have cont. to wikipedia there has been no decision made, I can not understand your actions ! 

Having now had the rules for vandalism explained to me I believe you have abused your power as my contib. clearly dosent fit any of the terms ? I ask you to reaccess your actions.   
  
The decision was made at Wikipedia:Requests_for_page_protection#Huma_Abedin_.28edit.7Ctalk.7Chistory.7Clinks.7Cwatch.7Clogs.29.  Its common practice during an edit dispute such as this for an uninvolved admin such as Keilana to semi-protect the page to reduce the intensity of the dispute.  In any case, from the tone of Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons/Noticeboard#Gossip_magazines_as_reliable_sources it seems that semi-protection was the right call to stablize the article while discussion continued there and on the talk page of the reliability of sources.  '''''' talk 

I would question how uninolved you actally are give these messges left on my talk page:
And don't worry! You'll be able to edit that page in 5 days! Enjoy! —BoL 

And by waiting for five days is by just waiting and you'll be able to edit the semi-d pages. Don't worry, give Keilana some time! She's offline right now, and so am I. —BoL

You clearly statd vandalism as your reason for the protection i would not you made no contibution to the talk page and sort no concensus from you action! I will also ask you to explain you relastionship to those who have sort to remove the information ? I would also like to know why you have changed you id ? thanks I will be adding this information to the talk page and any were else i find help !

Reminder: Need consensus to reword
There have been some recent changes, in rewording text, so this is a reminder to seek consensus before attempting to re-write the article text. There are numerous issues to heed:
 The verdict was given by a """"panel of 8 judges"""" because the term """"jury"""" might be misleading to readers.
 Other people are named with last initial to protect privacy, even though fully-named elsewhere, per WP:BLP (as: Filomena R. or Laura M.).
 Be careful not to change the verb tense of events (such as """"have appealed"""" to become """"will appeal""""), when most editors have carefully chosen the wording of events to reflect the legal sources.
 Mignini has tried to sue organizations, so we want to keep text about him to a minimum phrase+source, while in the middle of other topics.
 Avoid trying to POV-push anyone's guilt or innocence, just word the text using common phrases, without trying to over-emphasize a legal ruling.
 Remember to use British English, such as: centre, centred, flat (apartment), US (for """"U.S.""""), behaviour, etc.
There might be other issues for the list above, to emphasize why we discuss plans to reword sections, and heed all the related factors. -  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Ancestry and racial origin are interchangeable and means the same thing. There is no need to play on words, but thank you for the feedback Rossrs, I appreciate yours. As for Mr.Wild, Well wildie she is not 1/4 this or 1/4 that, since when was this theory? Talk about sticking to the topic, You can look at the woman and see she is black! Her father is black! Her mother is part black! . Where is the complexity?? You want to get nitty gritty she mentions black 3 times and Puerto Rican once. That would make her 1/8th Puerto Rican if you want to go so far and that has nothing to do if it's black Puerto Rican lineage or otherwise.There's nothing complicated the only complication are you(zealot editors), who choose to use give blind allegiance to your clan members opinions  other than what is truth then turn around and hide under """"POV-pushing and much to-do over nothing."""" To get off topic a bit, Barack obama was a nigger, NOT nigga, but a Nigger up till Nov 4th or when it became apparent he was to become POTUS no.44. After that he then became mixed, then bi-racial then finally half white ,not half black mind you, but half white. Some person or persons feel very proud that this young lady has a trace of Puerto Rican lineage in her family tree and I have absolutely no objection with that naturally. But its just that,a trace, there is no need for a Puerto rican ascendancy with a link of Puerto Rican actresses and definitely no need to be stating Puerto Rican as a defining characteristic of her. It's trivial for she is far from being Puerto Rican both culturally and genetically. If anything there should be a native Amerindian link. Put the shoe on the other foot and this young lady was four shades lighter and possessed 1/8th African heritage and 'looked' Nordic. Would a link for African American actresses be up there? Would Black be mention first even if she had said it first??? You can bet your ass not! And you know it! I doubt it would even be mentioned. Matter of fact when I'm done here I'm heading over to the John Mccain page to kick up some dusk   for inclusion of his black ancestry, yes sir. And guess what else Mr.wild?

Why? Required? Well, these questions go back to the old days. It used to be thought that redirects were bad, and we should avoid them, trying as hard as we can to replace them with the precise name. Then it was discovered that Google found things easier through redirects, and they provided a way for us refine Google's search semantics quite a bit. So it helps people find what they want, and avoids the problems of having to be too precise about linkages. Its more of a wiki way to do it. Not to mention that this type of linkage comes from our disambig policy, to use disambig pages liberally, but always be hierarchical according to common sense. More recently it was discovered that tools to """"fix"""" redirects (like the one in WP:POP) are hugely taxing on the server, so that ended the last of the purists crying about link precision. The funny thing is that link precision is actually a hindance to semantic searching. So, over the years the idea has been to make WP redirects function as a part of the semantic web.

Unless there have been drastic changes since I was there I think it would be hard to make the argument that AS is """"one of the strictest private schools in the United States"""".

Hi Lulubyrd, would you be so kind as strike out or remove your post for the reasons I explained in the ANI thread? (Reader's digest version: because it's not true, I even gave you a diff, and because I'm bothered you'd say such things). If you would do, then perhaps I owe you an apology for not WP:AGFing and assuming you wouldn't. It's not like our paths will cross very often, if ever, but why not score another friend?

Like you said in the article talk, the sources I cited didn't support """"Sabbatic Witchcraft"""", and... hey now, believe it or not, I was aware of that. You are welcome. Polemics make it difficult to communicate effectively.. there was no dispute, and no good options... but if you had renamed the article Sabbatic Craft, no one would have undone it. Better still, if you had suggested deletion and mentioned there was already a writeup in Contemporary witchcraft, I would have been behind that 100%, (even just mentioning the latter, I'd have suggested the former), with redirect 'natch.

""""Sabbatic Current"""" works ok as a section header, but because it's so obscure, it couldn't be used for the article per the guidelines for WP:TITLE, and while """"Sabbatic Craft"""" would have been better in that regard, it's supposed to be proprietary—the kanundrum... In addition to struggling with the guideline, I was trying to find a way to go by what Chumbley said too... and that's consistent with what you thought WP should do, yes?

Do you have any concerns with the redirects for Sabbatic witchcraft and Sabbatic Craft?

It's a sure bet you know way more about Sabbatic Craft than I intend to learn. What did you think of the changes I made to Contemporary witchcraft#Sabbatic Current? Is there a particular section in the Chumbley article that would be good to point the Cultus Sabbati redirect to? (My impression was none in particular, but I only read it once through).

Reply to note on article talk page
For the copyright issue, it is not enough to assert permission: you would have to follow the steps in the warning notice above. Be aware that in posting information on Wikipedia, you are making an irrevocable and very general release by which others may copy your text, modify it, and use it for any purpose - see Foundation:Terms of Use and WP:Copyrights#Contributors' rights and obligations.

But there are other issues. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a business listing directory, still less a web-host for you to """"provide online the content of our corporate documentation,"""" and it is unlikely that your documentation is suitable for an encyclopedia article. 

Also, in writing about your company, you have a conflict of interest.
Wikipedia is not a vehicle for any kind of promotion. Articles have to be of enough general interest for an encyclopedia article: the Wikipedia term for that is notability, and the requirements are explained in the guideline on Notability and in more detail in Notability (organizations and companies). Articles need to be verifiable from independent, reliable sources - a company's own website does not count as independent - and independent references are the best way to demonstrate notability. Also, articles must be written from a neutral point of view, and so people are strongly discouraged from writing about themselves or their own organizations, because of the conflict of interest involved. If you do write on such subjects, follow the advice in User:Uncle G/On notability#Writing about subjects close to you:
When writing about subjects that are close to you, don't use your own personal knowledge of the subject, and don't cite yourself, your web site, or the subject's web site.  Instead, use what is written about the subject by other people, independently, as your sources.  Cite those sources in your very first edit.  If you don't have such sources, don't write

Extracted guidlelines of note from sections 6.1.1 and 6.1.2:

To be avoided
 Switching between major citation styles, e.g., switching between parenthetical and  tags or between the style preferred by one academic discipline vs. another

Generally considered helpful
 Imposing one style on an article with incompatible citation styles (e.g., some of the citations in footnotes and others as parenthetical references): an improvement because it makes the formatting consistent

By following GA-criteria I am led, with no uncertainty, to a sound conclusion and made the reasonable request that all references be made consistent. They are currently a mixed bag of s and . Per WP:CITEVAR this is avoidable and unhelpful, and therefore unacceptable, in my opinion it fails the GAN requirement to follow MOS:LAYOUT closely enough.

The only support which matters is next year at election 2012. The experts say that Manipuris are backward and need to be educated about democracy. The arab spring has taught the experts that it is the people who need to educate their political masters on what kind of democracy they want. I hope Manipuris at last take the opportunity to free Sharmila and rid Manipur of the black law next year.

On 28 November 2010, UK Green Party leader and European Parliament member Keith Taylor wrote to the Indian government seeking the release of Sharmila and the repeal of the AFSPA. Her main supporter in the European Union is Sir Graham Watson KB MEP  chair of the India/EU delegation of MEPs. He has consistently made interventions on her behalf most recently to Dr J Bhagwati Indian Ambassador to the EU who responded on 1 July 2011 to his request to respond to the death threats made against Irom Sharmila. Indian Ambassadors reference BRU/AMB/48/2011 Embassy of India, 1050 Brussels. He responds only that he understands that Irom Sharmila is a hunger striker and that the modification of AF(SP)A is under consideration. Previously in April 2011 Sri Graham Watson and the EU delegation had tried to visit Manipur but were not allowed to do so by the Indian Authorities. They visit each year this year they were allowed to visit, Delhi, Patna and Mumbai. Although Keith Taylor did write three letters on one occasion he has never responded to further input. Sri Graham Watson and other members of the EU delegation do always respond to further requests for help. For example a Dutch member of the India EU delegation Peter Van Dalen whose special interest group is Dalit and subaltern groups released this press statement for publication at the gathering at her tenth anniversary of fasting in November 2010  Smt Sharon Bowles MEP sent Sharmila a personal letter of support which is now with Sharmila. She had added her personal regret that Sharmila was not nominated for the Sakharov last year due to insufficient support from other MEPs a nomination requires at least 40 MEP signatories. This year's nominations close on 13 September 2010. Another MEP member of the EU/India Delegation has stated that he does not believe Sharmila will be nominated this year either as very few MEPs know of her or Manipur.

The European MEPs were initially brought in by one of her Western campaigners Nicholas Crawford a philosophy student at Gonville & Caius College, Cambridge. He also chairs a small student think tank. The Wilberforce Society. At the annual garden party Mr Crawford gave a speech about Irom Sharmila and the AFSPA in attendance was their patron Lord Wilson, a former head of the civil service, and Sir Christopher Hum, former UK ambassador to China. Before Xmas they hope to have a seminar on India and Human Rights. And plan to visit Manipur and Sharmila next summer. Sharmila has many letters from offices of Western Dignatories including those of HM Queen Elizabeth II, The Duchess of Cornwall, The President of Eire, Tony Blair and most recently the Scottish First Minister and the Mayor of London all stating that they are sorry about her circumstances but are unable to offer her any assistance. But she has always cared more about genuine letters seeking to make connections.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 So you think that something like feline animalism is an assertion? I don't think I'm making myself clear at all then / Your page says you have a BA in Philosophy - are you familiar with much philosophy of language? Perhaps you'll like seeing a more formal argument:
 Assertions are statements: things that can be true or false (cf """"is it raining?"""", which is a question not a statement)
 A common, sensible, and relevant use of ID is """"we came about through intelligent design, not evolution""""
 That makes no sense if ID is a statement, so ID can't be a statement (cf """"we came about through one phenomenon, not the other"""")
 If ID isn't a statement, then it can't be an assertion (QED)
Where do I go wrong? ((Compare ID to lamps, Marxism, and Goldbach's conjecture: """"I assert [that] lamps"""" makes no sense, because """"lamps"""" can't be true or false. """"Marxism"""" also can't be true or false. But """"every even integer greater than 2 can be written as the sum of two primes"""" can be.

I noticed the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under fair use, but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our first fair use criterion in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed image could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information. If you believe this image is not replaceable, please:

 Go to the image description page and edit it to add , without deleting the original Replaceable fair use template.
 On the image discussion page, write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all.

Alternatively, you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject, requesting that the copyright holder release this (or a similar) image under a free license, or by taking a picture of it yourself.

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified how these images fully satisfy our fair use criteria.

To the best of my knowledge, lightening is correct.
There is no such thing as """"digital lighting"""". It's still lighting. Digital would only describe that the lighting is controlled digitally. This has absolutely no effect on the actual light and thus no effect on the image.
If I'm not mistaken, lightening would refer to processing to increase the brightness of shadows, which increases the noise as both noise and the signal is boosted (signal to noise ratio remains the same). I'm not sure if there could be a better word than """"lightening"""" though. Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to explain where the original noise in the shadow comes from, and I'm not sure if this could be consider a """"true"""" noise source as it looks like its simply boosting already present noise.

Unless if there another meaning for shadow noise?

 ==How it is - Answer== 

How it is

 He was a Romanian citizen
Not only Romanian! He was born a Austrian-Hungarian citizen (1913). He was a Soviet citizen too, for a long time, it is not clear if he ever got back the Romanian citizenship.

 He was a member of the PCR (thus a Romanian Communist)
... and of many other communist parties! No need to stress so much the romanian party. The romanian party was illegal at the time and it was considered a terrorist group; membership to such a URSS-sponsored group does not make """"Roman"""" Romanian. He was never a Romanian Communist; maybe you mean """"a member of the Party of the Communists from Romania"""".

 He lived in Romania
... and also in Spain, USSR, Czechoslovakia and France. Do not put undue stress on Romania.

Most of all, Neulander was a Soviet agent and comissar, ennemy of Romania, agent of occupation, whose mission was to establish communist rule in occupied Romania. Now stop spreading the anti-Romanian propaganda.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Re your block of User:Witysmartone 

Hi, just wondering why you only blocked for 24 hours?  If you look at the contribs that user has failed to make a single constructive edit so far - normally that warrants an indefinite block?    
Nothing too mysterious. ) The user was only active for about 40 minutes, in all. In my experience with basic vandal accounts, the duration of the block only rarely makes any difference in practice. Most times, they never return even after a short block. In the event they do return, they'll either continue disrupting the project (in which case it's easy enough to re-block) or will contribute helpfully (in which case we're better off than when we started); in the former case, the indefinitely blocked vandal will be quite able to return using another account, anyway, so the term """"indefinite"""" can be a bit misleading. If there is a danger in this strategy, it's in allowing a number of iffy accounts to sit around autoconfirmed, but we tend to do that already, with a few thousand every day. –

 Claims of Non-Neutrality from the Non-Neutral, a.k.a., Double-Standards for Darwin 

Hello,

I'm writing to report a case of non-neutrality from the user . After editing the page on Irreducible complexity to make it more neutral, my changes were reverted, and I received the following message from the aforementioned user:

Welcome to Wikipedia, and thank you for your contributions. One of the core policies of Wikipedia is that articles should always be written from a neutral point of view. A contribution you made to Irreducible complexity appears to carry a non-neutral point of view, and your edit may have been changed or reverted to correct the problem. Please remember to observe this. Thank you. ID and the like is virtually universally disregarded and is not taken seriously by the scientific community. To say that only """"some"""" of the scientific community is giving WP:UNDUE weight to a minority position, a position based on theology, not science SÆdon 

I'm fairly new here to Wikipedia, but I understand the basic rules regarding article editing, particularly involving mandatory neutrality. I'm confident that none of my additions were non-neutral in any way which biased the article. They were criticisms of criticisms of irreducible complexity  precisely the sort of thing expected for a neutral, fair-and-balanced article on irreducible complexity. Surely neutrality requires that both arguments for and against controversial ideas be presented, no? What the actions of SÆdon and the other watchdogs of any article involving the Darwinian evolution vs. intelligent design controversy say is that only one side of the issue, theirs, deserves to be presented. This is textbook neutrality  exactly what Wikipedia strives to avoid.

Notice the non-neutrality in Saedon's message:

ID and the like is virtually universally disregarded and is not taken seriously by the scientific community.

This is an example of either dishonesty of ignorance on Saedon's part. Intelligent design is one of the hottest topics in science today precisely because it is taken seriously by the so-called """"scientific community."""" They take it seriously because it's a very powerful, evidence-based argument that poses a great threat to the current orthodoxy, Darwinian evolution. This is why Saedon and the like watch over any and all articles regarding this debate, making sure they remain heavily biased towards Darwinian evolution, while reverting both arguments for I.D. and criticisms of criticisms against I.D., as happened in my case.

To say that only """"some"""" of the scientific community is giving WP:UNDUE weight to a minority position, a position based on theology, not science

To say that only """"some"""" of the scientific community views I.D. as pseudoscience is a factual statement. While they may be in the minority, there are many members of the scientific community who agree wholeheartedly that I.D. is science. To close your eyes, shove your fingers in your ears, and pretend that these scientists do not exist  as Saedon has done  is intellectual dishonesty. To then permeate Wikipedia with that intellectual dishonesty is unacceptable. Notice, too, Saedon's non-neutral opinion that intelligent design is theology, rather than science.

I refute that claim.

I'm atheist regarding the Gods of any organized religion, and yet I fully accept the scientific-basis of intelligent design. It's no more theological than is big bang cosmology, or even its counterpart, Darwinian evolution. While all three views may have (a)theistic implications, the argumentation and observation behind all three are strictly secular and scientific. For Saedon to baldly assert that intelligent design is theology, and use this bald assertion to further justify his non-neutrality, watchdog-like behavior is unacceptable.

I expect this situation to be dealt with accordingly; fairly, without bias, and absent bald assertions and loaded claims that encourage, if not outright justify, that bias.

Thank you.

Re: Hughes.  Yes, I think you're right that they were no longer lovers at that time.  But you didn't change """"was her lover"""" to """"had been her lover,"""" you just deleted the entire paragraph, which I dispute.  Instead, I propose:  With the help of Howard Hughes, who at one time had been her lover, she purchased the rights to the play and turned it into a hit movie.  The movie was very important to her career and it's an interesting and pertinent detail that Hughes was so involved in helping her make it a reality.  I certainly don't want to perpetuate errors, but let's talk about how to fix them instead of just deleting information wholesale.

Re: Hepburn and Tracy's living situation  what would you suggest instead?  How about something like... Hepburn and Tracy were undeniably a couple, but only lived together regularly until the last few years of Tracy's life. Even then, they maintained separate homes to keep up appearances.

Re the Hughes/Hepburn engagement  I believe there was a NYT article that announced their engagement, or announced that it was off, but I haven't had time yet to find it.

Re Hepburn and Smith's marriage, from Higham:  The marriage was a disaster. Kate had such a horror of domesticity that the whole experience was a nightmare. She evidently realized that she had married on a whim and that marriage was totally incompatible with her need for absolute freedom of thought and action.  Three weeks after the marriage took place, the couple separated.  Faced with the fact that he had a failed marriage, Luddy sensibly decided to continue with Kate on a platonic basis.  She remained legally married to him for several years.  Do you have something that refutes this?  I'd be glad to source it specifically to Higham in the text of the article if you like.

Even so, that does not imply that: Mexico could not possibly use any """"generous financial support"""" to buy the arms, ammunition, or other war supplies for the very reason that the U.S. was the only sizable arms manufacturer in the Americas. To make matters worse, Germany could not be counted on to supply Mexico with war supplies directly, as the British Royal Navy controlled the Atlantic shipping lanes.

As the editor 148.247.186.142 has pointed out, Mexico could buy weapons produced in Argentina, or use the Argentinian companies as intermediaries. Moreover, as the same editor also pointed out, the 75% of the fuel used by the British Royal Navy in 1917 was produced in Mexico. Hence, without fuel the British Royal Navy could not control the Atlantic shipping lanes at all. Actually, it is not a coincidence that the UK took Persia in the partition of the Ottoman empire of 1918, considering the fact that the Anglo-Persian oil company was founded there in 1908; and the UK had learnt the lesson: it is really dangerous to depend exclusively on the oil produced in only one foreign country. Well, they learnt the lesson until the oil crisis of 1973. Finally, let us also recall that the US made plans in 1917-1918 for invading Mexico and taking control of Tampico oil fields, but the US also calculated that Mexicans would set in fire the oil fields before they could arrive there; the classical scorched earth technique applied by the Russians against Napoleon and Hitler.

Usually people does not take into consideration that Mexico had a super-weapon in 1917: the oil fields, because mass production of oil in Saudi Arabia began until 1945.189.203.69.72  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Here in Wikipedia, blogs are not considered reliable sources. That rule will be enforced with special vigor for articles where sock puppets have tried repeatedly to insert hype into the text.

You were asked to discuss your addition to the article on the talk page. Rather than that, you chose to reinsert it without discussion. This is considered edit warring, a behavior which is especially despised by these same trigger-happy administrators.

I suggest you keep your nose clean by removing the questionable edit, raising it on the talk page, and responding in a suitably contrite manner to anyone questioning your veracity.

 Response to the lies in your RFC TAB 

HiTAB 

I posted this response to your RFC on Canaen.TAB I believe you removed it.

I would like to point out that in British English the word nark is non-pejorative and I understand that it has an objective meaning something akin to a """" snitch """" in American. That is, meaning someone that makes, often erroneous, allegations to authorities in order to personally benefit themselves in some way.TAB 

The funniest thing for me is that you are busy digging a hole in your own canoe because your allegations are lies. You are entirely wrong. I know this because I know who I am and I know with whom I have and have had connections and I take a very minor little offence at being accused by the likes of you of being something I am not. I state """" very minor little offence """" because you and your views genuinely are so unimportant.TAB 
You are an individual of very little decency and integrity. I do not state this as an insult but as an objective statement. You have been told on many occasions that I have no connection with this or these other individuals and yet you not only continue to go on making such allegations but you even use them as the ground to make an attack on another individual.TAB 
Don't worry, Karma will come and get you in its own time.TAB 
 TAB 
 ==User conduct RFC==TAB 

Please be advised that I have filed a user conduct RFC on you. It can be found  here. Cheers,  TAB 

Just out of interest, who do you think this nark  is and why is he so motivated to go about doing what he is doing? I put this record up in the open for you and them to see because I have no and have had no connection with you nor any of the journal pages and, frankly, I take offence at being called a meat or sockpuppet of yours when I am not. I am sure that you are just or even more upset as being accused of a connection with me when you have none.TAB 

Unfortunately though, that is the depth of 's lies and the shallowness of 's integrity.TAB 
 Where he has no grounds he invents them and he is, oh, so clever at playing WikiTricks with all these technical terms and methods.TAB

I became involved in editing the vegan article before you returned to it recently. I am entirely responsible for kicking this whole thing off because I refused to let  get away with his ridiculous domination of the article and I put  in the same category for his anorexic stuff.TAB 

From my point of view, my objections are largely literary. The article became too bloated and required editing down. It is merely meant to be a definition of what vegan is. I don't see any point in actually engaging in those that oppose veganism. I don't even support vegan's trying to counter counter-vegan propaganda on the Wiki. It is best to keep it short and simple and give a few links so that folks that are interested can go find out more.TAB

99d98bd28aed53b4,"Context of the Women's Health Movement 
I think it is important to note the context of which Carol Downer figured out how to do vaginal self-exam and menstrual extraction during the woman’s health movement at this time, the early 1970’s, abortion, birth control and fertility information were not available to women. In addition, there were an estimated 5000 deaths a year from illegal abortion. This concept helped put reproduction and the woman’s body back into the hands of the woman in a safe way. I also feel as though some of the language used in this article has a negative connotation. For example, when it is stated that she “promoted a procedure called menstrual extraction... if she were pregnant, this would constitute a non-professional abortion.” it sounds as if the article is trying to claim that she promoted abortions, which isn’t necessarily true. What she did promote was women reclaiming their bodies and taking them out of the hands of the male-dominated medical world and into their own. She PROVIDED women with means to learn about their bodies at a time where birth control did not exist. I also think it should be noted that after Roe v. Wade, she traveled to Europe, Canada, New Zealand and Mexico, to name a few, and attended national and international conferences as advocates of women’s health rights. In addition, I think it should be specified what the Roe v. Wade decision entailed, and how it made abortion legalized so she was therefore able to establish the women-run clinics. Roe v. Wade has a Wikipedia article and can be linked. 

These contributions are important because the context all of this was a very important time in Women’s Health History. Mentioning the context of the women’s health movement and how she was providing women with the means to take control of their fertility and reproduction when they had no other means to do so and could even face legal persecutions if they did. By adding this, the article will make more sense, especially because it mentions her arrest and things like the Roe v. Wade trial.

From an ES/WGS perspective, the revolutionary time where woman began to take back the control of their bodies. There are many misconceptions around things like abortion even still today. Woman have been criminalized for performing or having abortions in history and even today. And I think it is important to take note of that. Also, Carol Downer has played such a crucial role in Women’s Health and Feminist activism, I was surprised at how short her article was.

The Alfred de Grazia that was purported to have done all the things attributed to him by you is the same as my father; however, I cannot say why he said any or all of these things, or what the Army actually used him for, or if and why he posted the picture as him when it wasn’t and isn’t. I replaced in the place I found it the actual picture of him posing in front of the stacked bodies at what I am sure was Buchenwald, and Anne-Marie von Hueber – de Grazia said that he had also been to Auschwitz. I did not know this until she made the statement on Facebook in connection with the photo. My father tended to self-aggrandizement and liked Jews who he thought were very smart. He also tended to be a Sophist, or sophistical. He could have written a lot with intent, or purposively. But still, why are you choosing this man, who did so much for humanity, as any sort of model for any sort of behavior that you might find unfavorable to your interests? The Nazis made their own bed and dragged the German people into it. The bombing of cities had already begun in WWI with German Zeppelins hitting London. The British chose to be the first to bomb German cities in WWII, but it would have started with German bombers in due time. I wandered the battlefields of Europe for years, just feeling the pain and division; even in my own mind and family, and grew up with young men and women who had lost their parents in the War, years before. Find someone else to pillory. Al de Grazia should be left in peace; he did his duty and it was rough from the start. He accomplished miracles considering all. Wikipedia is not good for you or your cause; it is filled with crap that anyone with a brain can see is made up to suit the authors’ purposes.

I believe in a Theocracy [Isaiah 9:6,7].The Holy Spirit is my govenment.He calls me to be perfect[Matthew 5:48],there is no higher form of government than this.I am also a pacifist,and I believe as a Christian I am called to become a spiritual warrior against evil,not a material warrior.I believe both good and evil are spiritual forces,one is Light and the other is darkness. I see all secular governments in this world as my enemies.Whether Atheistic Communism,such as is seen in China and North Korea,or Democracy.

As democracy becomes more and more secular,it becomes more and more my enemy.If democracy is to be truly secularized,then everything pertaining to God would need to be removed from it.I do not see the removal of God and the replacement of atheism as being an improvement
in my world. Democracy ultimately must be my enemy,it is to complex,and it has to much material power for it to be a true branch of Christ's Government.

I was shaped by Secular humanism at a very early age(10).I was not raised as a Christian.I accepted the theory of evolution in school,and became an atheist. This was a disaster for me,my life reached a dead end.I began searching for God,and found all of the answers to life's mysteries that were previously unanswered.
Many """"Christians"""" want a complex form of government such as democracy
to do their dirty work for them,such as fight their material wars in 
order to """"save them"""". My relgion teaches me that God is the only one who can save me.Many attempts have been made by both secular and religious governments to """"save us"""". Any government which is backed by material weapons is antichrist[Matthew 5:43,44].

Because you're just interested in being annoying and insulting people on their talk pages. Go do something constructive. Read a book. Watch a film. I don't care what it is. But if you have evidence that you're pestering me for reasons other than being an obnoxious ass, take it to a noticeboard. Just keep in mind that the last 2 times you took editors to a noticeboard for things they didn't do, the result was not in your favor.

For a quick answer to the problems you were having: the fields such as  and  don't need any wiki markup such as brackets; the template puts that all in by itself.  So, for example, the exact code I used to make the template show up the way it does now is as follows:

 Migrants and refugees 

A refugee is, according to the 1951 Refugee Convention, any person who """"owing to a well-founded fear"""" of persecution is outside their country of nationality and """"unable"""" or """"unwilling"""" to seek the protection of that country. To gain the status, one has to go through the legal process of claiming asylum. The 1951 Refugee Convention: http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49da0e466.html

As soon as someone fleeing persecution and mortal danger gets into a country where he/she is no longer persecuted but still caries on """"fleeing"""" without invitation by a third country, he/she is no longer a refugee but a migrant.

 Hungary during the Holocaust -The Kastner train 

             The 1955 Kasztner libel case: the verdict of Judge Benjamin Halevi.
The state of Israel claimed that Malkiel Grünwald's allegations against Kasztner were a lie. When Grünwald published these accusations, the Israeli Government did rather more than demand that his views should not be broadcast. Because a prominent Zionist official (Dr. Kastner was a spokesman for the Ministry of Trade and Industry) was involved, the Attorney General of the State of Israel prosecuted Grünwald for criminal libel. Let the verdict of Judge Benjamin Halevi (who later became one of the panel of three judges that tried Eichmann) in Israel's District Court of Jerusalem speak for itself.
The Attorney General v. Malkiel Grünwald
This material should be studied carefully. The masses of Jews from Hungary's ghettos obediently boarded the deportation trains without knowing their fate. They were full of confidence in the false information that they were being transferred to Kenyermeze. The Nazis could not have misled the masses of Jews so conclusively had they not spread their false information through Jewish channels. 
The Jews of the ghettos would not have trusted the Nazi or Hungarian rulers. But they had trust in their Jewish leaders. Eichmann and others used this known fact as part of their calculated plan to mislead the Jews. They were able to deport the Jews to their extermination by the help of Jewish leaders. The false information was spread by the Jewish leaders. The local leaders of the Jews of Kluj and Nodvarod knew that other leaders were spreading such false information and did not protest. Those of the Jews who tried to warn their friends of the truth were persecuted by the Jewish leaders in charge of the local 'rescue work'. The trust of the Jews in the misleading information and their lack of knowledge that their wives, children and themselves were about to be deported to the gas chambers of Auschwitz led the victims to remain quiescent in their ghettos. It seduced them into not resisting or hampering the deportation orders. Dozens of thousands of Jews were guarded in their ghettos by a few dozen police. Yet even vigorous young Jews made no attempt to overpower these few guards and escape to nearby Rumania. No resistance activities to the deportations were organized in these ghettos. And the Jewish leaders did everything in their power to soothe the Jews in the ghettos and to prevent such resistance activities. The same Jews who spread in Kluj and Nodvarod the false rumor of Kenyermeze, or confirmed it, the same public leaders who did not warn their own people against the misleading statements, the same Jewish leaders who did not organize any resistance or any sabotage of deportations . . . these same leaders did not join the people of their community in their ride to Auschwitz, but were all included in the Rescue train. The Nazi organizers of extermination and the perpetrators of extermination permitted Rudolf Kastner and the members of the Jewish Council in Budapest to save themselves, their relatives, and friends. The Nazis did this as a means of making the local Jewish leaders, whom they favoured, dependent on the Nazi regime, dependent on its good will during the time of its fatal deportation schedule. In short, the Nazis succeeded in bringing the Jewish leaders into collaboration with the Nazis at the time of the catastrophe.

The Nazi chiefs knew that the Zionists were a most vital element in Jewry and the most trusted by the Jews. The Nazis drew a lesson from the Warsaw ghetto and other belligerent ghettos. They learned that Jews were able to sell their lives very expensively if honorably guided. Eichmann did not want a second Warsaw. For this reason, the Nazis exerted themselves to mislead and bribe the Jewish leaders. The personality of Rudolph Kastner made him a convenient catspaw for Eichmann and his clique, to draw into collaboration and make their task easier.

The question here is not, as stated by the Attorney General in his summation, whether members of the Jewish Rescue Committee were or were not capable of fulfilling their duty without the patronage of the S.S. chiefs. It is obvious that without such S.S. Nazi patronage the Jewish Rescue Committee could not have existed, and could have acted only as an underground. The question is, as put by the lawyer for the defense, why were the Nazis interested in the existence of the Rescue Committee? Why did the S.S. chiefs make every effort to encourage the existence of the Jewish Rescue Committee? Did the exterminators turn into rescuers?

The same question rises concerning the rescue of prominent Jews by these German killers of Jews. Was the rescue of such Jews a part of the extermination plan of the killers ? The support given by the extermination leaders to Kastner's Rescue Committee proves that indeed there",0,0,0,0,0,0

The question at hand is whether these are true facts that are pertinent to this Wikipedia page and thus deserve to be judged by the people who read it. This is, after all, a page in the Wikipedia and not your personal property. Is that not so? These facts are as follows:

1) Substantial numbers of horses which show many characteristics of purebred Appaloosas have been found in 2014 living in a remote mountain valley of Kyrgyzstan near the Chinese border. These horses exhibit spots, white sclerae, and striped hooves.

2) a DNA analysis conducted by Dr. Gus Cothran at Texas A & M University shows that these Kyrgyzstan horses closely match purebred  American Appaloosas in their genetics.

3) As of 2015, controversy exists as to whether these horses should be considered true Appaloosas. A BBC documentary shows the 69-year-old female New Zealand Appaloosa breeder who rode horseback over a 13,777 foot mountain pass to find these horses. This documentary clearly shows these horses in their native milieu and discusses the DNA evidence.

Now Mr. Montanabw Sir, are those facts not true?  Are they not germane? People come to this Wikipedia Appaloosa page to learn current and pertinent facts about Appaloosas. In that context neither your opinion nor mine count for a plug nickel.

Therefore I will now repeat my question . Exactly why are you continuing to refuse the addition of these facts to this Wikipedia page? If you wish, I don't see why an additional section cannot be added entitled """"Kyrgyzstan horse controversy"""" containing this information. Can you? 

Because if we can't resolve this question here, that is the issue I am going to ask the next level to resolve. I will not ask them to decide about LP genes or whether the BBC has made up some fairy story about the Appaloosa or whether the moon is made of green cheese. I will ask them whether you are in your legitimate rights to deny the inclusion of this information to the Wikipedia readers. Am I speaking clearly enough, Mister?

 RFC 

I didn't say the sockpuppet issue wasn't relevant, I said it couldn't be proven and if he insists he's not JB it should be dropped.  The stuff with JB happened around the time I started on Wikipedia and I saw a little bit of it and have to agree that they have similar editing styles.  However, if we can't prove that Booyaka is JB, then we have to judge Booyaka's behavior on its own merits.  If, on the other hand, we can prove that Booyaka is JB, then Booyaka can be blocked.  

As for """"However when Booyaka replaced the tags and ignored the notes on the edit summary - that's when it became vandalism.""""  No, it's still a content dispute.  It's an inappropriate action, but not vandalism.  Read WP:Vandalism, especially the part about what vandalism is not.  I would call replacing the tags """"Bullying or Stubbornness"""".  Not right, not good, but not vandalism either.  Accusing someone of vandalism when they aren't vandalising takes a bad situation and makes it worse.  

You said, """"There are limited editors in Australia and New Zealand, so the obtaining of third party sources is hindered severely in the time sense.""""  I see that, hence my advice to him to go easy on the AFDs and just use {{unreferenced}}.  Not that I think he'll take my advice.  However, there is a growing movement to speedy delete unsourced articles, see Wikipedia:Speedy deletion criterion for unsourced articles (which you might want to comment on).

As for your asking if I was an admin, no I am not.  If you specifically wanted comment from admins and not regular users then RFC wasn't where you wanted to be.

And what do """"quanta"""" and """"cosmology"""" have in common?  Energy.  To simply categorize physics as """"the study of everything"""" is imperceptive.  When modeling sand falling into a pile (or nuts sorting in a jar) a physicist doesn't really care about the identity of the particles at hand, just certain """"bulk"""" properties that relate to its energetics.  The chemist tries to understand how the material composition in turn generates those energetic qualities, but then usually isn't capable of formulating the dynamic description of what happens when it's shaken (or spilled).  A physicst usually could care less about why niobium is better for a collider than copper, just that it is.  And chemists don't just care about chemical elements and compounds, there is a whole field of chemistry dedicated to monitoring interactions of nuclei with nucleons (nuclear chemistry)  still matter.  As a point of culture, chemists tend to focus on the diversity of matter and how that affects interactions with energy and physicists focus on the unity of energy, and how that affects matter.  Physical chemists very nicely bridge this  they put quite a bit of energetics while still caring deeply about the identity of that which is being studied.

No... we only categorize """"standard biographical information"""" (year of birth/death, religious affiliation, national identity, etc.) and those things that are related to what """"makes the subject notable"""".  In Graham's case his masonic credentials are not what """"make him notable"""". It does not really matter what Graham may have valued or what he was proud of... What matters is what sources (such as historians) think is of value.  If there are sources that discuss his Masonic credentials, and talk about how they affected Graham's life and his achievements, then he would be Categorized. 
The truth is, being a 32nd degree Mason is not that noteworthy... any 3rd degree Mason can become one... all it takes is paying an initiation fee, and spending one afternoon watching the degree ceremony being performed as a play.  In fact, you don't even have to take the 4th - 31st degrees as a prerequisite (you can jump right from being a 3rd degree to being 32nd).  Now, if Graham had been a 33rd degree things would be a bit different... that degree is somewhat rare and is a special award given for service.  
As for being elected Master of a lodge, even that is not that notable... most lodges elect a new Master every year, and since there are tens of thousands of lodges in the US alone, this means that there are literally hundreds of thousands of Past Masters in the US.  In smaller lodges, it is not uncommon for every member of the lodge to have a turn as Master.  Now... if Graham had been elected Grand Master of an entire Masonic jurisdiction things would be different... state or national level Masonic office is somewhat notable (there are only hundreds and not thousands each year), and that is the level of notability that deserves categorization.

 BLACK DAHLIA MURDER IS NOT 'MELODIC DEATH METAL'!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THEY ARE DEATHCORE PUSSIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

Black Dahlia Murder IS NOT Melodic Death Metal. They are the farthest band from that genre. Black Dahlia Murder are pieces of shit scene bitches that are trying to be """"METAL"""" along with all of the other Deathcore/Grindcore bands like Job For A Cowboy, Suicide Silence, etc. Fuck all of them! They aren't true Metal and they never will be, they need to stick to what they know...American Eagle, MTV, and all of their other lame trends. Melodic Death Metal is Scar Symmetry, In Flames, Sonic Syndicate, and Disarmonia Mundi. Melodic Death Metal is REAL music, it's not a disgrace to music like Deathcore and Grindcore.

I will continue to change Black Dahlia CUNT'Murder's genre to Deathcore/Grindcore, I don't give a shit..I'm not letting you stupid scene bitches take away the only thing that you and the Mainstream hasn't destroyed and that's the amazing genre of Melodic Death Metal. So fuck all of you trendy conformists, go fucking die.

Black Dahlia Murder are Deathcore pussies that need to be beheaded, them and all of the other Deathcore bands that are ruining Metal.

Deathcore is the biggest piece of shit I've ever heard...it shouldn't even be considered music, it's a bunch of pussy scene kids trying to be """"METAL"""". Deathcore and Grindcore are the two worst forms of music ever invented.

So yeah, you can listen to Deathcore if you enjoy hearing """"music"""" that has no tempo or beat to it whatsoever, they pretty much just hit random shit on the drums and play random notes on the Guitar while the vocalist does terrible random screaming and pig squels. Don't forget the hillarious millions of breakdowns they put into their songs.

""""DA...THIS SONG IS CALLED BIG FUCKING TREE!""""

""""Ya boi....we are so down wit American Eagle..ya boi, my hair does that flippy thing.. RAWR RAWR RAWR I'M SO LYK HARDCORES OMGZ@!!!@@!!!! GAGES AND SNAKE BITES RAWWWRRR""""

Fuck Job for a Cowboy and Black Dahlia Murder, trendy pieces of shit.

Melodic Death Metal owns all. 

There really isn't much of a difference between any """"Deathcore"""" band for that matter, they are all just a bunch of pussies that are trying to fit in with this new trend of trying to be a """"Metal"""" band.

So please don't try to tell me """"OH...YOUR STUPID...THE BANDS AREN'T THE SAME.""""

Ok, so maybe....JUST MAYBE.. Job For A Cowboy's vocalist does 3 more pig squels in a second than the vocalist from Black Dahlia Murder, there I said it! I guess they aren't all the same!!!! Oh dear fuck ..... And my bad...my bad, White Chapel actually does 200 breakdowns in a minute rather than Suicide Silence's 100 breakdowns in a minute. My bad dude you were right all along!! Deathcore and Grindcore bands aren't all the same!!!!!!!!!

But seriously, the genre is pure shit and is just another trend in the music industry that bands are following to """"make it to the top"""" and to fit in with the rest of the bands these days.

I mean, I have nothing against every band in a certain genre sounding the same or anything, but when the """"music"""" of the genre they produce is pure shit and can be done by any living human being on Earth...then I have to draw the line. It doesn't take much talent to do shittty raw screaming, hit random notes on a guitar, and hit your double bass pedal at like 500bpm.

Another reason why I don't take any bands from this genre seriously is their hillarious excuses for a """"band logo"""".

They try oh so hard to be """"HARDDCOREEEEE"""".

I also find it funny that all of these pussy bands have names like, """"ANAL CUNT"""" or """"DEAD DEATH BLOODY DEAD HAND"""".

Fact is, any band that produces """"music"""" under this genre sucks and is just trying to fit-in.

YA BOI! LETS HARDCORE DANCE! RAHHHH YAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Grindcore and Deathcore isn't Metal so all you douchebags should just give up....you aren't Metal and you never will be, go fall into a pool of AID's. 

Fuck Black Dahlia Murder, I'm not giving up....this is insane, I'm not letting you mother fuckers take away the one thing I have that you haven't ruined.""",1,0,1,0,1,0

When someone claims for a Macedonian person to be a Bulgarian, is an offense to the Macedonians, similar or worse when someone calls Bulgarian a Tatar. Kolisevski has always stated he has a Macedonian ancestry.
He had done a lot to stop the Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda, that claims a lot of aspects about Macedonian Nation to be Bulgarian.
These views do not exists in reality. These views are coming from the 19th century Romantic movement of the new Balkan nations, like Serbia, Bulgaria and Greece. After they got independent from the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century, and Macedonia being under the Ottoman rule until early 20th century, all of these neighboring nations had assimilation policies towards the people living in Macedonia. The fruit of this policies were the first and second Balkan Wars when the territory of Macedonia was taken over from the Ottoman Empire and divided between these neighboring countries. And according to the new rulers of these territories, they were inhabited by Serbs, Bulgarians and Greeks.
Bulgaria got the smallest part, which was the reason for starting the Second Balkan War.

If you haven´t read the galling article, how do you know it´s something wrong whit it? I can assure you that everything I put the Wikipedia galling article it is extensively peer-viewed and approved at Karlstad University, Sweden.

  

What is this """"live-chat service"""" that you speak of? I haven't ever heard of one. The proper way to discuss the templates is here on the talk page of the article. All three are applicable because: 1.  the English needs to be improved 2.  you have pretty much taken ownership of the article 3.  the article needs more wikilinks. Hope that explains it.   

Hi dude, Wazz up , why didn´t you include my entire massege?

Are you kidding me?, so you don´t have a """"Wikipedia live-chat service"""", strange because I used it, and if that isn´t possible must sombody be realy evil. No suprise to me when the whole world is bullying and abusing people who have no means of fighting back, with the exeption of trying to make it so clear how horrific the discussion, realy can be. And it is to be hoped that somewhone in the crowd of onlookers finally realize the unreasonable and unjust in the many´s bullying against an unknowing victim or potential plaintiff.

Regarding your, , complaints quotation: """"you have pretty much taken ownership of the article 3."""" end quotation, I can only reply that there are several others who make contributions to the galling article and I only make sure it´s scientificly correct with regards to syntax and source. 
Some parts have I watched extra carefully, for example the pictures because I made them and it´s therefore easy for me to correct the content and syntax of the description. 
Other peaople are free to write any knew exiting findings and I will not change anything as long it´s has warranty.
A lot of the text have been changed by others over the years and is still present in the article so don´t blame me for something that clearly isn´t true.

I realize you are not happy with the current turn of events. However, in a project like Wikipedia, where pretty much everyone can post anything, and challenge anything, it happens. Sometimes edit wars devolve into situations like this.

The deletion debate process has to be available to prevent people from cluttering up Wikipedia with all sorts of stuff. Some can abuse the process; some can resort to it in good faith and turn out to be wrong.

Personally, I have no knowledge of whether this is a prominent web server or not. I don't know whether the other party is just being antagonistic or really believes Zeus is not worthy of inclusion. There is a Wikipedia policy to try to assume good faith on the part of everyone, whenever possible. To respond by going after other products, or attacking Boborok, would be a mistake.

The proper way to handle it is to gather information to bolster your case. Look for industry publications that have written articles about Zeus (note: not forums, they don't carry much weight). Any statistics you can find (again from reliable sources) on the prevalence of the software would help. Post links in the Articles for Deletion discussion so that others can review them. You will find that other Wikipedia editors are reasonable people, and if you make your case, calmly and reasonably, you will find it listened to. Forget about Boborok, and whatever his motives may be. Concentrate on the subject at hand.

 Logic is a central area 
I quoted above from Syracuse University's web site  the """"four core areas of philosophy"""" that students must study are The History of Philosophy, Ethics and Moral Theory, Metaphysics and The Theory of Knowledge (Epistemology), and Logic. Now from Harvard University  basic required courses are an introductory course and one each from 1. Logic, 2. Contemporary metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of science, philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, 3. Ethics, political philosophy, aesthetics, and 4. History of ancient, medieval, or modern pre-20th-century philosophy. Stanford University  basic required courses are an introductory course and one each from Logic, Philosophy of science, Moral and political philosophy, Metaphysics and epistemology, and History of philosophy. Major research universities seem to agree that all undergrad. phil. majors must take a logic course (and, incidentally, that metaphysics and epistemology can be lumped together at this level). While what undergrads. must take is hardly the be-all and end-all of phil., it certainly indicates to me that logic is a major area in the minds of academic philosophers. I also consider """"The Development of Logic"""" by Kneale and Kneale  to support this position; from pg. 1 it puts """"not simply valid argument but the reflection on principles of validity"""" in the context of Plato and Aristotle.

9a70f2c3b9d16f5b,""":Dear Federico, when I have the time, and I promise I'll make the time, I'll delete any true ad hominem remarks (""""dense"""" would be a good example). Not only do they not belong on wikipedia, but as a student of logic, it is a classic logical fallacy to use an ad hominem remark to form an argument. But as I said, I feel passionately about the subject, and it has brought out the worst in me.

However, certain comments I will not remove. A claim of hypocrisy is not an ad hominem remark, it's a statement that one's views are contradictory, that proposes one standard for one case, and another standard for another. As such hypocrisy is not an ad hominem remark, rather it is used to describe inconsistent statements or behaviour.

For example, you mention that """"You have to show me where the statistics of historians’ opinions about Hiroshima and Nagasaki decision is. Does it include Soviet historians, Japanese historians, Chinese historians, South American historians, East and West European historians, Africans historians, Arab, Indian historians? Or only include U.S. Army historians? Even in that case, opinion of the majority is still OPINION, not fact."""" Fair enough, but later on you say """"it's been stated many times that the Americans were only thinking of saving American lives through the A-Bomb. The Japanese never came into it. They did not care at all about Japanese lives, so your reasoning is invalid."""" Who said this? You impose such high criteria for my statement that the A-Bomb saved human lives, requiring experts from all over the world, but soon after you baldly assert that my reasoning is invalid because """"it's been stated many times..."""" Stated many times by who? According to your very own criteria, you need to provide evidence from Soviet historians, Japanese historians, Chinese historians, South American historians, East and West European historians, Africans historians, Arab and Indian historians. But you don't. You merely state """"it's been stated many times...therefore my reasoning is invalid."""" Apparently Loomis has to provide sources, but we can take Federico's word for it whatever he says. That, my dear friend, is hypocrisy. And you, my dear friend, are a hypocrite for reasoning in such a way. Calling you a hypocrite is therefore not an ad hominem remark and I therefore will not remove it.

And by the way, thank you for pointing out my typo when I put a K in the word """"recognize"""". Again, it seems that when Loomis makes the slightest spelling typo, its fair game to point it out, but when Federico makes numerous spelling, grammar, syntactical etc... mistakes, its impolite to recognize and show sensitivity towards the fact that English is not Federico's first language.

I have more to say but unfortunately I have an appointment. Hopefully I'll get back in time to finish this before you read it. In the mean time, I truly mean it when I say that I consider myself a soft-spoken, agreeable person. Isn't all this mea culpa proof on anything? Speak to you later and all the best.

Bonjour, mon chéri David! Thank you so much for the kind and encouraging message! I must say that, as a European, I fully agree with your reserves towards the usual American expression of """"best in the world""""; and just like you, it's not anti-americanism at all, just the common uses of a particular country.

I also concur with your appreciation regarding some of the more """"dark"""" episodes and their wording. I tried to be as objective as possible, but always something slips through the net. This shows how valid is to listen to other readers' thoughts and concerns, because a different opinion can always show you were one's work can be improved. The phrase regarding the brutality of McNelly's men that worried you has been rephrased, within the facts presented by the source; so thanks to you, now it's historically accurate and clearly presented.

I've also done a full re-reading of the article to discover any other places where this could happen, but I have not observed any, to my humble opinion. At other parts where brutality and violence are exposed (like the early 20th century), the wording is presented in a much more clear way, I hope: I mention them as """"sordid misdeeds of brutality and injustice"""" (properly sourced), which I humbly believe to be a straight general description without going into particular examples that would take much space. The same could go for """"300 up to 5,000 people, mostly of Hispanic descent, had been killed by Rangers"""" and """"Reports of Rangers abusing their authority and breaking the law themselves became numerous"""" (sourced again). Do you agree with me, David? I'd love to hear your thoughts.

As you see, I've put immense effort in creating and enhancing this article, and I wish to address all your concerns with my best effort until you consider it worthy of becoming featured. Nothing would please me more than seeing all the points that you correctly raise solved satisfactorily. My warmest wishes,  smile! ''''""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Observe:

A=B.

Multiply both sides by A and you get:

A2=AB.

Add A2 to both sides to get:

A2+A2=A2+AB.

Using addition we get:

2A2=A2+AB.

Subtract 2AB from both sides:

2A2-2AB=A2+AB-2AB.

Thus:

2A2-2AB=A2-AB.

Combining terms on the LHS:

2(A2-AB)= A2-AB.

Divide both sides by  (A2-AB):

2(A2-AB)/(A2-AB)= (A2-AB)/(A2-AB).

Cancel out like terms and Viola!  We now see:

2 = 1.

I would like to ask to have the deletion of the page ANA SANTIAGO be reconsidered on the following grounds:

A. This person has founded and heads the only Impact Evaluation Network in Latin America and the Caribbean. This network is part of LACEA (http://www.lacea.org/portal/index.php), the most important international association of economists interested in doing research in the region. She is a permanent Honorary Member of LACEA, award given by her contribution to impact evlauation reserach and policy relevance for the region ( http://www.lacea.org/portal/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=24&phpMyAdmin;=b883a10db6c19d415348047740f5c4b0&phpMyAdmin;=f18f79e76e8f09c4b5c658d1db20ad3f).The contribution of founding the network is is widely referred to and attended by policymakers, governments, NGOs, and academics in the field. This contribution falls into the category """"creative professionals"""" of the notability criteria, mostly 2 and 3 with c) of number 4:

""""Creative professionals

3. The person has created, or played a major role in co-creating, a significant or well-known work, or collective body of work, that has been the subject of an independent book or feature-length film, or of multiple independent periodical articles or reviews.
4. The person's work either (a) has become a significant monument, (b) has been a substantial part of a significant exhibition, (c) has won significant critical attention, or (d) is represented within the permanent collections of several notable galleries or museums.""""

B. Further, this person is part of the very small team of persons that have been given the mandate from the Haitian government to redesign a major reform and reconstruction of Haiti's education system following the 2010 earthquake. This has been cited in other pages such as MARCELO CABROL

""""Reconstructing Haiti's Education system after the 2010 earthquake: President Preval gave the Inter-American Development Bank, IDB the mandate to work with the Education Ministry and the National Commission preparing a major reform of the Education System in a 5 year plan.

C. Finally, she leads the all the research and evaluation of one of the main Multilaterals (IDB) on Education topics, directly responsible for ongoing pilots and evaluations for over 200 million dollars. Part of this work has been taking the implementation and designing the impact evaluation of the Teach for America (national teaching corps) model to the region currently in place in Chile, Peru, Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia. The evaluation design improves on the US evaluations so far, fac that has been recognized and cited in the region and outside (including the US and Europe) by Wendy Kopp, founder of TFA.

 Figures in the infobox... once again 

I found this:

The Russian defeat of Berlin was inevitable for they outnumbered the Germans in men 5:1, guns 15:1, tanks 5:1 and planes 3:1. < that's a lot more (2x more men, and no German artillery in infobox at all).

Until recently the Russians had claimed that they lost 10,000 men during the battle for the Seelow Heights and 100,000 in Berlin. The actual figures are unknown. Yet no less than 30,000 Red Army soldiers were killed at Seelow, and the staggering figure of 600,000 killed in Berlin seems more plausible. Konev complained at one point that he was losing 1,000 men a day because Zhukov's artillery failed to shift fire when asked. Zhukov denied that allegation, stating that Konev was not using his troops intelligently. < now a HOLE DAMN LOT more (Wikipedia now claims only 81,000 Communist soldiers were killed in the whole operation, while even the OLD Soviet figures were appearently more 100,000 in the city alone). 

I'd like to note Battle of the Seelow Heights says 35,000 Communist soldiers were killed in this battle, which is even more than claimed by these sources.

Other source (modern Russian): The Battle of Berlin was a costly and bloody one with over 300,000 Soviet casualties. The number of German losses is unknown but roughly 480,000 were taken prisoner. (infobox says """"134,000 captured"""")

Still another: However, it should be noted that the Soviet Union placed their own casualties as over 300,000 in the two weeks of fighting from the Oder to the collapse of Berlin.8This number included killed, wounded and missing. Interestingly, recent western sources place the total casualties suffered by the Soviets as even higher. (...) Although the exact estimate of Russian casualties during the battle for Berlin is unclear (infobox says """"81,000 killed"""", etc - while everyone knows the Soviet numbers were completely unreliable.)

How about just not putting any figures, as are really just unknown? 

Also, Britannica about overall Soviet (unknown!) losses:

Available estimates of Soviet casualties vary widely. A Soviet officer  who served with the high command in Berlin and left the Soviet service in 1949 placed total military losses at 13,600,000 8,500,000 dead or missing in battle; 2,600,000 dead in prison camps; 2,500,000 died of woundsand estimated civilian casualties at 7,000,000. These figures have been widely accepted in Germany, but most U.S. compilations, based on Soviet  announcements, list 6,000,000 to 7,500,000 battle deaths. Calculations made on the basis of population distribution by age and sex in the 1959 U.S.S.R. census give some credence to the higher figures, for they seem to indicate losses of from 15,000,000 to 20,000,000 males of military age in World War II. The figures used here are a compromise estimate, not intended to obscure the fact that Soviet casualties are, in reality, unknown in the West.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

9ace530c4c711d19,"I never said it would happen. I just said that I wouldn't be suprsed if it does. I made that guess based on everything that's happened so far in Naruto, and the way Kishimoto creates plot twists of this kind. Now your comment is what seems fanboyish and unjustifiable. Kabuto already seemed to have a kind of kind of second nature back during the first part of the series where his eyes would change color when he got mad. Kishimoto wouldn't give him a similar state to Juugo, because it wouldn't be something that new and because he wouldn't want to have two characters be so similar. And as for my Orochimaru possesing Itachi theory, just because something happens at one point doesn't mean it will be the same story next time. By your logic, just because Kakashi needed the help of his students (look 2-3 people right there!) to bail him out of Zabuza's trap during their first meeting, that would mean Zazbuza could have easily killed him during their second meeting when they were fighting alone. Or just because even Gaara's own father, the Kazekage himself, feared Gaara's power, a genin like Naruto shouldn't have been able to beat him let alone after he transformed. Or how could the Uchiha, being the strongest clan of Konoha, be killed so easily by a single member of their village? See? You definetly chose the wrong story to bring up that kind of logic. Practically every single fight in Naruto craps all over it. Orochimaru COULD take over Kabuto, and go on to Itachi after Sasuke's team has weakened him. Perhaps they cause him to overuse his Sharingan eyes, who knows? Orochimaru could find him, make his move, steal his body, and seek vengeance on Sasuke. The point is just that neither of us knows whats gonna happen and we'll just have to read the story.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Basic concept of GPS
A GPS receiver calculates its position by precisely timing the signals sent by GPS satellites high above the Earth. Each satellite continually transmits messages that include
 the time the message was transmitted
 satellite position at time of message transmission
The receiver uses the messages it receives to determine the transit time of each message and computes the distance to each satellite using the speed of light.  Each of these distances and satellites' locations define a sphere.  The receiver is on the surface of each of these spheres when the distances and the satellites' locations are correct. These distances and satellites' locations are used to compute the location of the receiver using the navigation equations. This location is then displayed, perhaps with a moving map display or latitude and longitude; elevation or altitude information may be included. Many GPS units show derived information such as direction and speed, calculated from position changes.

In typical GPS operation, four or more satellites must be visible to obtain an accurate result.  Four sphere surfaces typically do not intersect.  Because of this, it can be said with confidence that when the navigation equations are solved to find an intersection, this solution gives the position of the receiver along with the difference between the time kept by the receiver's on-board clock and the true time-of-day, thereby eliminating the need for a very large, expensive, and power hungry clock.  The very accurately computed time is used only for display or not at all in many GPS applications, which use only the location. A number of applications for GPS do make use of this cheap and highly accurate timing.  These include time transfer, traffic signal timing, and synchronization of cell phone base stations.

Although four satellites are required for normal operation, fewer apply in special cases. If one variable is already known, a receiver can determine its position using only three satellites. For example, a ship or aircraft may have known elevation. Some GPS receivers may use additional clues or assumptions such as reusing the last known altitude, dead reckoning, inertial navigation, or including information from the vehicle computer, to give a (possibly degraded) position when fewer than four satellites are visible.

For one, there was no fire (which it says in the main article and flight 296 article) only smoke from the release of oil from the broken bearing. Secondly it was the passengers who opened and tried to exit on the wrong side (not sure how that is Ryanair's fault that passengers would exit towards the firefighters) Thirdly, the only problem for Ryanair is that some of the staff had trouble opening the doors but still everybody was able to evacuate in 90 seconds.

 Still concerned about balance 

I've put in a fair bit of time on the article, both in verifying/cleaning content and filling in material, enough that I think I can say I have gone over things in detail.

Look, for example, at Korea and the Caribbean/Cuba/Cuban missile crisis; those are a start on what I think is encyclopedic coverage. Just to say, with no other background, that the CIA trained police or set up an Operation Gladio network really doesn't give information; I'd recommend waiting for more background and context.

There are news reports from reputable journalists, but there are also quite a number from activists for varying positions. I'm afraid I don't give equal credit to a staff writer for the Washington Post and for the Revolutionary Worker.

The article is impossibly long, yet its covert operations section is full of fragments. It's going to have to break up so those fragmentary sections can be edited; it's taking a long time to save the file now.  Note that I was able to put estimative/analytic material in for Korea and Cuba. Much data of that sort is available, often in the form of the actual declassified documents. Not to put in relevant reports, National Intelligence Estimates, etc., gives the impression that the agency is purely covert operations, since the reports were almost never mentioned for countries I sawjust controversial """"dirty tricks"""". That's not NPOV.

Many sources are available for the report literature, including the George Washington University National Security Archives, the Avalon Project at Yale, the archives at Mount Holyoke, the military staff colleges and research institutes, the Foreign Relations of the United States series, and even the CIA FOIA Reading Room. There is, for example, a huge amount of reporting about Southeast Asia, including strong disagreements among the CIA, military, Office of the Secretary of Defense, and White House (Sam Adams' book, War of Numbers is excellent, but also see the Pentagon Papers).

I'd like to suggest that people editing this look at some of my articles on the process of intelligence, which may help understand things that aren't just covert destabilization. Start with Intelligence cycle management, which will take you through a hierarchy of articles. The HUMINT sections do deal with clandestine rather than covert activity; I'm actively working on them. The article on Clandestine HUMINT and Covert Action is particularly relevant both in history, and balance between clandestine and covert activities. Especially in WWII, there was often a conflict between operations and intelligence gathering. 

Please let me help, but understand that my reaction is that things come across as very accusatory and unbalanced. Believe me, I am very aware of both improprieties and just plain incompetence in intelligence agencies, and they need to be brought out  but in an encylopedic, not fragmentary and accusatory way.

I lack the time to contribute many Wiki edits but I have been listening in on the current arbitration. I've noticed something that may be of interest.

You mentioned  here that one side Mosmac has been portrayed as """"a fragile consensus"""" and yet on the other recently start claiming the opposite.

One doesn't even need to look that far. 

Even in the current arbitration some editors are characterizing the use of """"FYROM"""" as evidence on disruptive Greek nationalists...
... yet on the other side they seem to be claiming that Mosmac wasn't a consensus to justify the move to plain """"Macedonia""""?

If I was participating I would certainly consider asking the users completing about """"FYROM"""" usage to clearly state whether Mosmac was ever a consensus or not. IMO anyone who says """"no"""" is essentially suggesting use of FYROM was valid if contentious.

Do prototypes necessarily use a sort of """"prototyping"""" material? Aren't models made of a different material called a mockup or something of the sort? In that case, the chef example above doesn't work - the new creations are prototypes. 
As for the others, the newspaper industry does use prototypes. That is, the first version referred to above. The first version is the definition of prototype - the prototype is the first version.
The coal industry could benefit greatly from prototypes, and I'm sure they use them already. There are immense safety concerns, to name one only area in which a model, perhaps not full-sized, of a coal mine would work. Additionally, the coal mines themselves are not the only asset of the coal industry - you have countless types of vehicles, mining equipment, and support equipment.
Milking cows - there would of course be no cow prototypes, as cows are not the product of the dairy industry. Instead, milk is. And I would hope there is prototype milk - a sample of the milk throughout its development cycle to make sure it is safe and clean.
As for pet stores, it is right that they would doubtless have a need for a prototype. However, a prototype is used for a product. A pet store has no """"products"""", instead they offer a service. They do not produce pets, they recieve and sell them. Even pet breeders do not produce the pets, they just reap the benefits of reproduction.

And reminding people that citing policy is at best only half the work: you may have settled on what you think governs the issue, but you still need to convince others of the best way to apply it in a particular circumstance.

It states something that Kinsey concluded, and it is clearly attributed to Kinsey  """"Kinsey attributed this difference to female partners knowing more about women's sexuality and how to optimize women's sexual satisfaction than male partners do."""" We are allowed to mention researchers' conclusions, and this conclusion by Kinsey is especially relevant to the text. It's also what I just stated above: """"Obviously, women generally know what makes other women feel good sexually, which is what the researchers are saying."""" It is your opinion and a case-by-case basis that """"having orgasms most of the time during sex does not equal sexual satisfaction in a relationship."""" I state that because it's not the same case for everyone. It is also your opinion that lesbians experience less sexual satisfaction in a relationship. The sources you kept removing state the very opposite of what you assert about sexual satisfication in lesbian relationships. And because they do, you've asserted that they are biased and/or unreliable. They are not. Those sources are what most of the research states about sexual satisfaction in lesbian relationships. Most of the sources do not state what Schwartz stated about sexual satisfaction in lesbian relationships. Not even half of reliable sources state that. Her view is a minority view, and it's also an outdated view because of what I've noted already. It hasn't been replicated. New research on lesbian sexuality consistently reports the opposite of Schwartz's assertion about sexual satisfaction in lesbian relationships. And I reiterate that Schwartz was focusing on long-term lesbian relationships, not just on lesbian relationships in general.   

The article is not a comparison article. It mentions a few comparisons to heterosexual sex in the Research section because these comparisons are notable and especially relevant to the topic. This is because researchers have often studied that aspect of lesbian sexuality, to help them better understand it as compared to heterosexual sexual activity. They obviously didn't see that it was needed or especially relevant to compare lesbian sexual satisfaction to gay male sexual satisfaction. And since gay male couples don't include women, I can see why they felt that way. They were comparing how women are sexually satisfied by a different sex/gender. They brought heterosexual couples into it. It wasn't Wikipedia that did that. And we should report on it because they did and made it a big part of studies on lesbian sexuality. Simply listing stats doesn't sufficiently inform readers of this information, unless those stats are as detailed as the text. And you really need to stop citing that discredited Schwartz study as though it is a majority or widely held view among researchers. It isn't. But I agree that it should be included in the article. 

We don't have to list stats for the lines you quoted above. What we have to do is follow the sources. If the sources had stats, then maybe we would include those. But including them also doesn't mean that they would be traded out for the text material. The """"Other elements of lesbian sexual encounters include more full-body sexual contact"""" line is about lesbians only, and it's supported by two reliable sources. I understand that you take objection with that paragraph because it's stating that women in same-sex sexual relationships are more satisfied, sexually and in life in general, but it's what the sources say. Still, it would probably be better to attribute that to the author(s) reporting it. We don't have to present a survey that asked heterosexual women and lesbian women their sexual satisfaction levels. That is covered by the sources, and only material especially relevant to the topic of lesbian sexual practices should be included. And, yeah, you have made claims. And, no, you don't present sources. Not generally. For sources, all you've done is repeatedly note the Schwartz study, no matter how many times I point out to you that it is discredited, and you state that """"many other sources"""" show the opposite of the material you kept removing. If there were many other sources of such nature, you'd be able to present one other than the Schwartz study, which is not an opposing study (as in a study directly going against what the studies in the article have found).

Roy, good questions. Yes it's actual thrust data from the Columbia mission, STS-107. However you can't directly measure thrust. Rather it's calculated from other parameters such as chamber pressure. Also the thrust curve is generally corrected to constant sea level or constant vacuum thrust. In actuality the physical thrust would be constantly changing, even if engine thrust was constant (which it's not for the SRBs). I include below some more info I was preparing to post:

Because of the frequent confusion on this point, I uploaded a thrust/time graph for the SRBs. I also revised the thrust numbers in the article to reflect this. SRB sea level liftoff thrust is 2.8 million pounds each. Each SSME produces 393,000 pounds sea level thrust at 104% power level. Thus the shuttle total liftoff thrust is: (393,000 * 3) + (2,800,000 * 2) = 6.779 million pounds force, or 3.075 million kgf, or 30.16 MN. Using these numbers the SRBs provide 82.6% of liftoff thrust. 

This is confusing because many sources just blindly copy the 3.3 million pound thrust number, some even erroneously adding """"sea level"""" or """"liftoff"""" thrust. There are six possible thrust numbers for the SRB:

 Sea level liftoff thrust
 Sea level peak thrust
 Sea level average thrust
 Vacuum liftoff thrust
 Vacuum peak thrust
 Vacuum average thrust

The problem is most references don't state which they are using. This is why references state SRB thrust from 2.65 million lbs (probably sea level average thrust) to 3.4 million lbs (probably vacuum peak thrust).

When comparing SRB thrust to, say, Saturn V F-1 engine thrust, you must consider the different characteristics of each engine type. The F-1 is not throttlable, so excluding altitude variations always produces the same thrust. At sea level this is 1.5298 million lbs per engine or 7.649 million lbs thrust total. By comparision the SRB thrust changes over the burn time (see chart). Space shuttle total sea level liftoff thrust is 6.779 million pounds force, or about 88.6% of the Saturn V.

In theory you could compare the SRB thrust at T+20 sec which is somewhat higher, but that wouldn't be liftoff thrust.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Regional Security Office U.S. Embassy in Managua reported these incidents: 

Crime in Nicaragua is in high rise and the National Police does not have the resources to combat it. Crime in Managua has had a steady growth throughout the years. Managua the capital of Nicaragua is exceptionally extremely dangerous specially at night, street crime is very common. Majority of the violent crime that is on the rise is due to the countries extreme poverty and lack of jobs. The following incidents took place in March and April of this year 2007. 

Hotel Robberies 

On March 29, an American couple visited the city of Granada where they where robbed at gunpoint in their rental home. Several days before the couple was robbed they contacted the management about a missing light in the unit. At 11:30 a.m. on the day of the robbery, a Nicaraguan male in his late 20s (the suspect) was at the front gate of the property he said that he was there to fix the light. The victim walked the individual inside the home, where he inspected the light. The victim then walked the suspect outside so he could get his tools. As they got near the front door, the suspect stopped and pulled out what the victim described was a .25 caliber or similar to the type automatic pistol and demanded the American couple give him all their money. The suspect took the victim’s wallet, took all of the cash and then, at the victims request his wallet was returned holding only his identification, The suspect then departed the area on foot. 

On April 4, seventeen members of a U.S. missionary group were robbed at gunpoint while having dinner at their hotel in Managua. The U.S. missionary group was given housing at a locally-owned hotel located in a area not frequented by tourists. Four Nicaraguan males, including two armed with handguns, entered the dining room and took the group’s cell phones and all their money. Two of the suspects walked the members of the U.S missionary group to their hotel rooms where they stole their digital cameras, additional cash and iPods. The robbery lasted one hour, a hotel employee was able to get away and called the Nicaraguan National Police (NNP). The Nicaraguan National Police did not arrive, however, until after the suspects had left the scene. None of the victims were badly hurt. 

The Regional Security Office U.S. Embassy in Managua strongly recommends all visitors and tourists to Nicaragua utilize hotels and guest houses that have a front desk, security, or concierge that is staffed 24 hours a day; full-time uniformed security; access control precautions; a fenced perimeter and a well lit and patrolled parking area; and rooms equipped with safes for valuables and travel documents. 

Vehicular Break-Ins

In the early afternoon on April 21, a vehicle belonging to an American organization was broken into at a gas station in Managua. The vehicle had stopped at the gas station on Carretera Sur (South Highway), about two miles from the U.S. Embassy in Managua. When leaving the car to make purchases in the station store, a young Nicaraguan male approached the driver and said he’d watch the vehicle for money. The driver accepted this offer and the car’s passengers entered the gas station. When leaving the gas station, they found that the young Nicaraguan male who had offered to watch the car was already gone and they noticed that the rear passenger door window had been broken. A briefcase that held files and their identification documents where also taken from the rear seat. The young male who had offered to watch the car returned to the scene. The NNP took him in to further investigate the case but were unable to confirm his direct involvement in the crime. 

The Regional Security Office U.S. Embassy Managua recommends that travelers do not leave valuables where they can be seen in parked cars and, when possible, park in a location where the vehicle can be monitored or where they have cameras.

9b2e7000335d1d07,"What an irony? The very policies that are used to protect articles on Wikipedia are been exploited by some editors and nobody at Wikipedia can do anything. Nobody has any rights to stop editors who go on a rampage over an article just because of some pov of theirs, using the very policies of Wikipedia used to protect articles. I guess there is no system of checking the edits of such editors against vandalisation such that they can blatantly claim that whatever you report to authorities nobody is going to listen. This is not according to Wikipedia standards and also not healthy with respect to protection of articles on Wikipedia. 

Protection should be such that deletion and blanking should not be allowed to editors other than the author of the article or administrators. This would curtail vandalism to a great extend. It will also stop vulturism in editing wherein editors who do not contribute with any articles but just pick on other editor's articles for whatever reasons would be discouraged and genuine critics would be encouraged who will follow the procedure of mentioning on talk pages for editing.

Furthermore if there are issues it can be discussed in talk pages and updation made accordingly. 

If any author does not log in for specific period of time the article may be alloted to another editor or taken up by adminstrator or it can be locked and put up as library content which can be edited by any administrator. 

This would add international standards as one expects on Wikipedia and also encourge authors to provide more contribution.

Anyway still it is a huge effort by Wikipedia to maintain such a huge collection of articles, it does not matter if a few articles get deleted or vandalised or removed from Wikipedia just because some pov of some editors. I understand to gain something one has to loose something. It is perfectly alright for all administrators and other authorities not to do anything and watch an article getting ripped of part by part.

Nevertheless, this bio, which I wrote, does appear in various public forums so I hope that it doesnt present any problems.  Here is what I would like to say:

Andy Brick is a prolific composer, conductor and symphonist.  In 2003 Brick set a historic milestone conducting the Czech National Symphony Orchestra in the world’s first symphonic game music concert at the Gewandaus, Leipzig Germany to a sold out audience of 2200.

9b5bea4a3e269e30,"""Update: The Oreskes abstracts

 

Naomi Oreskes claims to have analysed 928 abstracts she found listed on the ISI Web of Knowledge database (1993 – 2003) using the keywords """"global climate change."""" However, this claim is incorrect: while the ISI database includes a total of 929 documents for the period in question, it lists only 905 abstracts. It is thus impossible that Oreskes analysed 928 abstracts.

 

In my original critique, I used the same ISI database and the same key words as Oreskes but used all documents listed therein. While Oreskes did not specify the method she applied in her study, she later confirmed that she had limited her search to “articles”, while I included “all document types” in my initial assessment. This difference appears to explain the discrepancy between the “928” abstracts Oreskes claims to have analysed and the 1117 documents I found and considered, although her figures don’t add up, one way or another.

 

Some commentators have argued that these differences undermine my main criticism while they validate Oreskes' claim. However, as I have stressed repeatedly, Oreskes entire argument is flawed as the whole ISI data set includes just 13 abstracts (less than 2%) that explicitly endorse what she has called the 'consensus view.'

 

In fact, the vast majority of abstracts do not mention anthropogenic climate change.

 

I have posted all documents and abstracts listed in the ISI database under the key words “global climate change” (for the period 1993 – 2003) below, arranged by year. Check for yourself! Make sure you differentiate between implicit and explicit endorsement of the IPCC consensus (“[M]ost of the observed warming over the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations."""")

I was speaking of infoboxes and templates in general, having none specifically in mind but rather they excessive sprinkling throughout the site. I just realized however that it is not as invasive here as on the French one (my port of call, so to speak; I only came here to steal the code for the picture of Beef Stroganoff), where they literally use templates for anything (even dates or not-so-large (>100) numbers) - but then these guys didn't offer me the chance to complain about it! But then even on the English version I would find that seeing the box code first thing when I open a page for edition is kind of a deal breaker.

Thanks anyway for the quick reply, much appreciated. I see someone already gave you a bunch of barnstars for that: keep up the good work!

Best regards,   

PS: since I'm at it, I should say I also have a hard time understanding why editing is in Times New Roman while articles are in Arial or Helvetica (sans serif). Just sayin' ;-)",0,0,0,0,0,0

Please read WP:UNDUE.
I've reveiwed the statement 'Dr. Michael Siedman a Michigan-based otolaryngologist who """"dabbles in herbal medicine"""".' and I believe it encourages a biased view against the subject. The subject in question has two degrees in the field of nutrition and two patents in a similar field. I appreciate the fact that the writer used the words the words 'dabbles in herbal medicine' while writing an article but using it as a basis for the doctor's description, given the majority of articles to the contrary, would be wrong and against wikipedia's policies.
Think what would happen if people chose to replace Bill Gate's qualifications in his wiki entry with some other article that described him as a man who 'dabbled into computers' just because a lone article described him in this light. If you have more than one article with a similar opinion then a case may be made. But basing an entire Wikipedia page on the opinion of only one article is a violation of wiki's rules.

Dear Antandrus,

You still did not answer my questions )  Which do not relate to the self promotion issue, which of course is clear. I will in the future refrain from adding any information about family members. But, If information arrives, which is factual, accurate and sourced. Regardless of editor. Should it be included? Isn't it a loss to WP? - And, is the Cello Sonata List (and this question applies to all open lists in WP) a list of all existing cello sonatas or only of certain Cello Sonatas to be determined by  administrators? 
In any case, thank you for your time in clarifying a lot about WP and its mechanisms. 

These are relevant quotes from information I have found in WP guideline pages:

""""Lists should always include unambiguous statements of membership criteria based on definitions made by reputable sources. """"

In this scase the list title is LIST OF CELLO SONATAS. So adding any existing and published cello sonatas should be valid unless the listing title is changed to narrow the list. I would suggest adding the criteria to Cello Sonatas that are in print or published. Do you agree?

And, I simply politely ask that if you have a problem with an entry, you tag the sentence or listing by adding the  or use another WP guideline way to allow for the editor to respond. Not simply arbitrarily remove. In particular with lists.

Thank you again for your time and I look forward to becoming more involved in the WP community. Kudos to all involved!

Hi again; thanks for promising to follow our COI guideline:  that's my main issue, as an administrator, with your edit that started this thread.  As an editor I have no problem with you adding or removing names from lists, and I encourage you to improve articles in any way you would like.  Regarding the list of cello sonatasthis is a problematic issue, and has to do with the evolution of Wikipedia.  Within the last couple years most of the embedded lists within articles have been moved to their own articles, but several years ago that was not the case (see the history of Renaissance music and List of Renaissance composers for an example).

 Misrepresentation of Eugenie Grandet's character 

The intro to this article says the Eugenie inherits her father's miserliness.  The end of the article states that she continues, as an orphan and widow, to live in his miserly ways, but without his obsession with gold.  This is not correct.

The one who inherits the miserliness of Grandet is Charles, his nephew.  Balzac states this explicitly near the end of the book when he says that this trait  """"found an outlet"""" in Charles, rather than his daughter.  Charles, grows from a callow and spoiled young man into a corrupt libertine and finally into a hard-nosed skinflint.

Eugenie, whose character is one of modesty, piety, and love, continues to live in the simple and austere manner of her upbringing, but she knows nothing else, and, having been betrayed in love, wants nothing for herself.  In tremendous contrast to her father, she is extremely generous with people, giving Nanon a fine marriage portion, distributing funds far and wide for charity, and endowing public institutions like libraries and hospitals.  Her personal austerity springs from a lack of interest in material comfort, not from miserliness.

  Mariupol  

Considering the claimed large death toll today and the notable events, coupled with the events from the previous days, what you say about an article titled Mariupol standoff?   

A large death toll doesn't necessitate a new article. We already have an article for Donetsk-related events, that is Donetsk People's Republic, in addition to the main article, 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine. As far as I can see, we have no need for a Mariupol article yet. If the violence continues in the way it is doing so at present, then I could see justification.  — ☎ 

I wasn't referring to the death toll ONLY. I was referring to all of the events from the previous days and weeks where we have the exactly SAME situation as Kramatorsk. An assault on the National guard base, three dead; attempted security forces recapture of city hall; second attempted security forces recapture of city hall; today's attack on the police headquarters, 3-21 dead. P.S. Today's events were not in the Donetsk people's republic article as you said, I only just now added them since apparently nobody else did.   
I'm sure they were. Perhaps it was in the timeline. Regardless, I just don't see the need for Mariupol article right now.  There is no reason why it can't be covered in Donetsk People's Republic. If the violence continues over the next few days, then I'd advocate for an article.  — ☎

Tragedy vs. Massacre
Considering the fact that no third-party source refers to these events as a """"massacre"""" I think we need to move the title to Khojaly tragedy to avoid any POV here. Massacre is defined as: """"an indiscriminate and brutal slaughter of people."""" British journalist Thomas De Waalthe one credible third-party that is heavily mentioned in article says that the tragedy in Khojaly was a result of a chaotic situation, and not a """"deliberately planned"""" action by the Armenians. Even those who wish to ascribe full blame on the Armenian/Karabakh side cannot argue that this attack was a planned event. The tragedy took place during the Battle of Khojaly. 

Helsinki Watch notes: Helsinki Watch reported that """"the militia, still in uniform, and some still carrying their guns, were interspersed with the masses of civilians"""".

Alternate terms for this type of story can be taken from the terms sometimes used for these puns.

 About what """"quick-failing"""" reeally is for 

efore conducting an extensive review, and after ensuring you are viewing an unvandalized version, check the article and its edit history for the following basic problems which are sometimes found in GA nominations.

 The article completely lacks reliable sources – see Wikipedia:Verifiability.Small articles that have a single main source may still be adequately referenced without the use of inline citations.  Inline citations may not be required for some articles; the criteria name the only six types of material that require inline citations.
 The topic is treated in an obviously non-neutral way – see Wikipedia:Neutral point of view.Articles on controversial topics can be both neutral and stable, but this is only ensured if regular editors make scrupulous efforts to keep the article well-referenced.  Note that neutrality does not mean that all points of view are covered equally: instead no point of view should be given undue weight.
 There are cleanup banners that are obviously still valid, including , ,  or large numbers of , , or similar inline tags. (See also .)
 The article is or has been the subject of ongoing or recent, unresolved edit wars.
 The article specifically concerns a rapidly unfolding current event with a definite endpoint.
 The article contains significant close paraphrasing or copyright violations

Another thing to look for is that if the article has been nominated more than once, go back to the previous reviews and make sure suggestions from the other reviews have been addressed.

If the article has any of the above problems, it may be premature to provide a detailed review, in which case you can """"quickfail"""" the nomination in accordance with step two of the GAN guidelines, as long as you explain this clearly on the review page. They most commonly apply when the nominator is inexperienced or is not a regular editor of the article. If you """"quick-fail"""" an article according to the above criteria, leave a short note explaining the major problems and inform the nominator.

Even if an article can be """"quick-failed"""" according to the above criteria, reviewers could also: 

 Leave a short note explaining the major problems, but without officially closing the review until the editors at the article have had a few days to respond to your concerns.  You may find that they are interested in significantly improving the article.
 Provide a detailed review, as more specific information will help future editors improve the article to meet all of the Good article criteria, but close the review as """"not listed"""".
 Withdraw from the review, and let another reviewer decide how to handle it.

Emphasis added by me. So please remember to always actually/carefully read any policies/guidelines before using them (and to not ask other users for opinions, because they might be completely misguided - just always find and read them yourself), like that (source).   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Discussion
I prefer to act transparently. Can I give my views on that determination here?  insignis 
 I sent you an email message asking for your opinion. I think that is pretty transparent.   
 That is fine with me, but some editors don't like it. It was a neutral invitation to a discussion, but it would be more open on a talk page - I did have the wikibreak sign up though. Thanks for the message though, I didn't notice the discussion start.  insignis 
 I wrote it in an email message when possible because those kinds of notification are not worth writing on user talk pages – since there is nothing to talk about. However, in two cases the users' had no email listed and in those cases I did write it on their talk page. See User_talk:Sarsaparilla#Review_of_deletion_of_page_User:Prester_John and User_talk:Christopher_Mann_McKay#User:Prester_John. I did not know that policy you linked to. Thanks for that.   
That is a good point, no reply is necessary. By the way, it is not a policy, rather a 'behavioural guideline' - I hope it is helpful. Regards,  insignis

 Speedy Deletion of """"Girl Power (Video)""""  

Hello, 

I recently established a page for Sadie Benning's video """"Girl Power"""". I've been notified that the page was challenged for its presumed insignificance (not enough """"notability""""). Considering the fact that feminist artists have been excluded from the mainstream art establishment and essentially omitted from history, I understand why one might thing a page dedicated to one of Sadie Benning's video MIGHT NOT have """"enough notability"""". However, I would easily respond by mentioning that ALL of Sadie Benning's video, ESPECIALLY her video """"Girl Power"""", played a pivotal role in the formation of Girl Power as a concept, radical feminist politics, and the Riot grrrl's commitment to the child icon. This video has been discussed amongst scholars and academics who focus on everything from art history to gender studies and from new media studies to sociology. If Wikipedia is supposed to be an encyclopedic database that indexes """"notable"""" historical and current events, then it would only make sense to include a page on this highly influential work that has greatly contributed to the emergence of feminist 90s politics and art. Any attempts to delete this page will be excluding important information about a widely-acclaimed video that has ONLY been excluded from historical documentation databases because of the artist's sex.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Requested move 6 November 2015

After Davis sent Aquino his acceptance on March 17, 1973, he was presented with the honorary membership on April 13, 1973 by Aquino and Karla LaVey alone. ASL did not meet Davis until August 1973. Davis would later renounce Satanism, claiming later he was """"only into it for the chicks"""" and re-embraced Judaism.

Edits in history of the tank

A while back you added some considerable information to the section /*Between the Wars*/, which was more in its place in the Tanks (1919-1939) article. I've moved/merged this information into the latter article and would appreciate it if you could look over both articles to see if nothing has been lost or inadvertely been duplicated?  

 Thanks, I made a few edits to it. I also removed a few small items that were correct, but not 'between the wars' info.

 This and that 

Firstly, I edited a chapter of my Meltyukhov translation a couple of days ago, but lamentably after my last save the Word annaounced that the file was 'corrupt'. Problems emerged while I was trying to send it via mail, as the copy of text I tried to add from recovered version of this 'corrupt' file was declared to 'contain no data'. The same thing occured, as I tried to post the whole text into my wikipage. I don't know what to do about it, I actually need this text for preparing an article in wikipedia as well (rough notes on my page) .

Secondly, (another unpleasant news) 'our mutual friend' Deng has become active again! See his changes to WW2 Eastern front proposal page. 

(Is it necessary to add, that he is obviously trying to revive the old story of 'bad Germanns and goodd Soviets'? He replaced a paragraph on Vlasov etc with his version of the events (a rather belletristic 'improvement', BTW), and usual English with his understanding of the English grammar...)  - Talk

 Phases of migraine terminology 

Migraine (history page) 
2006-10-08T13:23:04 Msteri (Talk | contribs) m (?Aura phase - This was NOT a typo. """"Headache phase"""" is appropriate AND from the source cited. Please do not change this again.) 

From User talk:Milomedes 
When I typed """"headache phase,"""" that's exactly what I meant. It was not a typo. Headache phase is as correct as pain phase, and headache phase is the terminology used in the source that I very carefully cited. Why did you feel it necessary to make this change? It makes no sense to me to take up people's time in this fashion. 
Thank you, 
 

This is a community issue so I'm moving it to the talk page. Milo  

First, I didn't think it was a typo. Both """"headache phase"""" and """"pain phase"""" terms are (or were) in use, though I don't know which is used more commonly. I do know that """"pain phase"""" is a better term for three reasons: 1) abdominal migraine isn't in the head, 2) the """"headache"""" word is recursively overused, 3) """"-ache"""" underdescribes the sensation, and, 4) """"pain"""" is shorter. You can argue with 2), 3),4), but 1) is technically a debate stopper.
Second, with all due respect to your professional writing expertise, just because you carefully copied the words that were used in your source, doesn't mean that I can't substitute different words that I have reason to think are better. I quote from concluding text at the bottom of every edit page: 
""""Please note: If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed by others, do not submit it. """"
Third, Wikipedia isn't about you or me. I didn't know you wrote it, and it shouldn't matter that you did. This is an interactive community process. If you think I'm taking up your time, then you probably don't have enough time to write here. Furthermore, if you assume that anything you write here is still going to be here, say, 10 years from now, then you probably don't understand the nature of Wikipedia. 
As to disagreements about which terminology to use in the article, that is usually handled with a talk page poll. I respectfully suggest that we use that tool as needed.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Yes it definitely isn't an ideal source, but unfortunately since these events took place in a very secretive, distant battlefield (Mike Spann was the first US casualty in the War in Afghanistan), the fine details of the event are limited to only a few sources, thankfully an experienced and respected English-speaking journalist was there shortly after events to record them. And yes unfortunately I know way more about this subject than I ever intended to. There were MANY previous edit wars, although I say more towards vandalism, which were mainly just people reverting edits on bias (same types of information  anything negative towards Lindh  was only thing removed) and saying the cites weren't right and making me have to go through sometimes hundreds of pages of documents (like the AR15 field investigation) and find the page number, paragraph, and line for them to prove the integrity of the cite to get them to stop. So needless to say I learned a lot about the case and read through most of the sources listed. (talk) """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Ice treaty?
This caught my interest:
According to a contract which had been signed, Russian America had to deliver a certain amount of ice to San Francisco at a fixed price.
Anyone here have any idea if this was with an American company or with the Hudson's Bay Company, which maintained a post at San Francisco, though perhaps not this late (their post was at Yerba Buena (town) and had been founded in 1830.  The reason I propose the HBC is that there was a treaty - more than one - between the RAC and the HBC on the latter's provisions of dairy and meat and vegetables to Russian America; maybe there was a reciprocal agreement.  I can't imagine what treaty'' the RAC/Russia would have had with the United States that could have signed between 1824 and 1859....unless this has something to do with US support during the Crimean War?  Or??  If it's a contract with a private company (other than the HBC), then """"treaty"""" is not the right word to use.  if it's a corollary to the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1839 or the earlier arrangements with either the Pugets Sound Agricultural Company  or some grandfathered contract re the agreement with Mexico over Fort Ross, somebody please explain....

 The article is incomplete 

Well written and interesting. Good.

I think the article would benefit from identifying the former bands of the members. What I find frustrating is that the article seems to assume knowledge of UK indie music. Why is it a supergroup? Who is Damon Albarn? Paul Simonon? Tony Allen? Simon Tong? I knew Damon, but I had to click 3 more links to find out the others. As an international wiki, anyone outside the UK will have no idea who these people are. The article should explain to anyone assuming no prior knowledge. Mention and link to the Clash, the Verve, Blur etc as well. 

After all, this is meant to be an encyclopaedia. It's not an article in NME, and space isn't an issue. Identifying the history of the members and explaining why it was considered a """"supergroup"""" is surely relevant to the article.

On another note - I only noticed who produced the album was here when I returned to it and looked at the top right side panel. I was expecting to find this at the bottom under the list of personnel. On my first visit I had to click other links to be certain that Danger Mouse had done it.

Review
 With this work, the authors, Mayoury and Pheuiphanh Ngaosyvathn, offer us a wealth of information on the history of a small kingdom, the Lao, centered at Vientiane, in modern Laos, caught between expanding core states (Burma, Thailand, and Vietnam) in the late eighteenth- and early nineteenth century. The authors draw upon a wide literature and an impressive range of languages to present a clear and careful picture of a very complex period in Lao and Southeast Asian history.

This book is really the story of Chou Anou, the last of the Lao kings of Vientiane and his struggle against rivals on all sides. Chou Anou played a political game between the expansionist Thai and Vietnamese states in the late eighteenth and ear]y nineteenth centuries, a game that his kingdom eventually lost. Because of the Tay Son, Vietnam was out of the picture for decades; the central Thai court was Chou Anou's chief antagonist. When Vietnam does enter the picture again under Minh Mang, it is as a supporter of Chou Anou, in the context of a larger Thai-Vietnamese competitive hostility. Fighting between Thailand and Vientiane appears on an extremely personal level in the text — the authors stressing at one point Rama III's anxiety that a massacre of Vietnamese emissaries and Lao guides by a Thai officer had not left enough dead, considering an earlier massacre of Thai by Chou Anou in Vientiane (p. 242); they stress also the personal nature of the fighting between Chou Anou and the Thai general Bodin. Further, the text seems almost to replicate, anachronistically, aspects of war more endemic to the post-World-War II conflicts in Indochina, including a reference to """"sophisticated Siamese psychological operations"""" (p. 212).

Paths to Conflagration is organized into nine chapters, each covering a different episode of the period, examined step-by-step, and turns from one incarnation of Vientiane to another — from victim to provocateur to buffer state. Each page is heavy with documentation, but the narrative is lighter. This book has three real strengths. First, it discusses history at the point of intersection between three different polities and does not apply the nation-state """"cookie-cutter"""" approach — looking only at developments as they relate to a state-centered narrative (thus framed by political borders). Instead of the history of Laos, we find here the history of a very turbulent period in which political borders did not mean very much in delineating the boundaries of action. Second, this book makes use of a very wide range of sources, especially from the Thai archives, spanning a large number of languages (including Lao, Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese, French, English, and German — both primary sources and secondary literature) and a multitude of perspectives. Third, this book focuses attention on developments sometimes left out of analyses of mainland Southeast Asian history, such as the all-important impact of migration, especially in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It is no mistake that migration is referred to over and over again in chronicles of the period, from western Burma to Vietnam, and that migration is used as metaphor for political change and state reformation for far earlier periods in these chronicles. Here too, migration played a very important role, as the authors stress both migration into the Lao kingdom, and forcible expulsion by the Thais, as a basis for the well-being and even survival of the Vientiane-based state.

 Solution 

This is save Venice, and I created a makeshift account under SV Solution. I have no intention in keeping it, nor do I wish to even continue to talk on these pages. After this statement, I will be closing it and just be Save venice. This was needed becasue of a childish block claiming me to be a vandal- how stupid.

Now, If Wikipedia is interested in a real solution to this problem that appears to have been going on for nearly a half of year now  with no end in sight, here is a solution (step by step):

1) I have looked into all of your backgrounds, and none of you are Venetain experts, please stick with what you know, and don't muck up good articles. Most of you are only interested in hoaxes, and seem you to enjoy talking about them, Stop doing that- it is not a solution. 

2) Having also looked into the background of this situation,  it is clear where the hoax is coming from, Fenwick High School in Oak PArk Illinois. Vitus must have went there, and these kids knew him or knew of him, they saw his name referenced on the Barbaro family page, and then proceeded to use his name into creating a fake secret society that he was NOT involved with. Shut down any mention of him in such a fake society, and the hoax is then neutralized. 

3) Go to the Fenwick H.S. talk page and get rid of all of that hoax stuff., If you have some issue about removing nonsense from talk pages than just file it away into an upper file, so it is there but out of the way, it is too inspiration for kids to perpetuate hoaxes.

4) go to Barbaro family talk page and do the same, now we have two nicely cleaned pages with files that can still be oponed.

5) If anyone post personal talk page comments on a talk page that is meant to be about an article, it must be transferred to a relevant personal talk page.

6) If anyone goes to the Barbaro family talk page and starts discussing matters about hoaxes and Vitus etc. It should be fair game to be removed. They should be viewed as trouble makers and people that desire to perpetuate confussion and hoaxes. 

7) I have also looked over the previous page you sent me, and the knowledge on that was also good, Spretti goes into detail about the family's Roman roots etc. It can be referenced, but I am not going to reference other peoples work, return the page we worked on together that is equally fine with a great picture on the top. It is a good over-view of the family, and it is enough, if people want to know more than they can do further research themselves.

8) Return the two head at the bottom as cited red links, and I will work closely with our expert on that, there is an interview with biographical info in the Family Record for the House of Barbaro. Also, red links show where further development needs to occur- there may be other people out there that has info too. Red links are useful. If you still have soem issue about them than just flag the section until they are fully developed as blue links, but leave them there there are useful to direct development.

9) Notify everyone on the nature of the hoax. The hoax is not Vitus or Antonio, it is kids using real people to create fake articles about secret societies that they were NOT involved with. 

10) Do just tlk about solution or send me petty blocking notices, be a leader take action to fix this problem by following the outline above.

11) My involvement in Wikipedia editing is based on what you do from this point forward. I will not play childish games or be treated in this manner. I am intersted in writing about other Venetian topic, next I would like to write about Palazzo Da Mula in Morano Venice. My focus is not just on the Barbaro family, I am happy to fix it and then move on.

RELATED ISSUES:

1) I am not the same Barbaro family representative called in to fix the problem, nor do I believe that that even occured, I suspect that Vitus and his clan could care less about Wikipedia. What I believe happened is some kids working at a school computer started all this (at Fenwick H.S.) and some teacher that knew Vitus and his family tried to step in and fix the mistakes of these stupid kid- she was probabaly afraid the family might sue the school for defimation of character. I highly doubt the Vitus would go through the trouble of bringing some """"Expert"""" to fix a Wikipedia article. 

2) I am NOT misguided, I know this family's history well an dknow for a fact based on creditable sources that Vitus and Antionio are acting heads. You will also find more info out there about Antonio's line because in Malta, titles are still holding political power, while in Vitus'case they are cultural titles devoid of powers. 

3) Finally, Antonio's branch is 100% the same family from Venice. Spretti p277: """"Ramo di questa famiglia fiori",0,0,0,0,0,0

 South China Institute of Technology 

Hello again
[Written before the block. Posting it anyway.] Hi Liuyg (or ). I have seen the Leiden ranking website. I did electronic searches for """"South"""" and """"China"""" but did not find South China University of Technology at all, so the page does not your claim that Leiden ranks SCUT as """"4th in China"""". If I made a mistake, just let me know what rank SCUT appears at, and I will add the information to the article myself.

Pages on universities have to present independently confirmed information on universities. Vague promotional language like """"world class"""" and """"top ranking"""" is not good enough. Also, you added no source to support your claim that SCUT was founded in 1924 and not in 1952. (Sun Yat-sen University was founded in 1924.) Besides, the long list of rankings is not proper Wikipedia format (see WP:UNIV): you should just name SCUT's rank and add the reference. Finally, your large edit is often made of incomplete sentences, and it removed a lot of useful wikilinks. You added too much flawed material at the same time, so I had to revert.

Some of the information you want to add might be valuable. Other editors, including myself, will help you if you add a small amount of material each time, or if you discuss your additions on the talk page. Wikipedia is based on discussion and consensus, so please stop adding this badly formatted, badly written, and badly referenced material all at the same time! Once again, I have to revert you, and I will notify an admin if you revert back again.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Dispute over Human Rights Watch citation

This edit is the latest in a minor fracas over this cite, which fracas began here when Wehwalt removed the cite from the lede, describing HRW as a """"pressure group."""" Actually, in this controversial topic, probably the majority of sources could be described as """"pressure groups,"""" but that doesn't make them reliable when properly cited. I restored the cite in a less prominent position here, at which point Wehwalt added a rebuttal sentence, with edit summary """"added explanation of why the IDF knocked down these structures, consolidated into the Background section."""" I found this problematic, because the article doesn't actually say what Wehwalt added; it says that the group analyzed the claims by the IDF, and found them to be largely bogus. So, to leave Wehwalt's edit in place creates a false impression of what the HRW reports. I modified the section according, which edit was then reverted by Wehwalt. I'm going to leave it alone for a day or so to give Wehwalt the opportunity to clean it up. Incidentally, in Wehwalt's latest edit summary, he says that """"This is the article on Corrie, not on home demolitions. We are to give the reader a modicum of info on this, not draw conclusions."""" First of all, it seems to me that Corrie is only notable because of home demolitions. Secondly, giving the reader """"a modicum of info"""" would be best served by an accurate summary of the HRW cite, whereas altering it for POV reasons would be an example of """"drawing conclusions.""""

The previous comment of the article states that MOC was not re-established in 1993, which is a fallacy. The MOC has been legally registered in Montenegro in line with the valid legal system of the state of Montenegro and in line with the laws in Montenegro - which is clearly apparent from the MOC page on Wikipedia. The MOC Church is called the Montenegrin Orthodox Church in its formal registration in Montenegro, so there is no space for speculation here. The Church was re-established after a separate existence until 1920 and a ban by the Serbian (then Yugoslav) autocratic King Aleksandar. 
The article does not claim that MOC is a major branch of Eastern Orthodoxy outside Montenegro. 

The statement """"over 74% of Montenegrins are Eastern Orthodox Christians, most of whom belong to the Serb Orthodox Church"""" is anyway a fallacy, as there is no accurate census that can prove this. One may say truthfully say that """"most Montenegrins are Eastern Orthodox Christians, most of whom belong to the Serb Orthodox Church"""", but a large number of Montenegrins are atheists, agnostics, or otherwise, myself included. Being a Montenegrin does not mean that you are part of the 74% of Eastern Orthodox Christians. Sorry, this is the 21st century.

You can not just delete the fact that MOC followers claim that """"all of the existing churches in Montenegro were once part of an autonomous Montenegrin Orthodox Church that was abolished following the union with Serbia in 1918."""" This is the explanation why shrines are not being built en masse in Montenegro by the MOC, as it claims to inherit the churches currently in the hands of SOC.

9c9aaeb0a341ffe9,"PROBLEMS ON KURDISH ARTICLES

First of all the Kurdish flag is allowed in Iran, but is not sanctioned publicly. Kurds have it in their homes and are allowed to have them. It is certainly not criminal in Iran for Kurds to have the Kurdish flag or symbol as many of my friends do. So edit your statement about it being criminal in Iran. Need I remind you all, that Kurds are ethnic Iranians and have historically enjoyed the greatest liberties in Iran as opposed to the mainstream discrimination Kurds face in Syria, Iraq, and Turkey?  
It is usually Israeli sources, with increasing American and British help and aid, that intentionally falsely claim that the Kurdish flag (which fly the Pan-Iranian colours as does the unofficial flag of the Azerbaijani people and the flag of Tajikistan) is prohibited in Iran. FLYING THE KURDISH FLAG IN IRAN IS NOT CRIMINAL AS IT IS MENTIONED BY ISRAELI SOURCES. 

Furthermore, I go on to read that there was research done that basically proves Kurds and Jews are genetically the same. It seems to me that certain individuals who I can see are Israeli are following the Israeli states policy of editing articles in lines with current events in the Middle East. Kurds are Iranians just as how Russians, Serbs, Poles, and Bulgarians are all Slavic peoples. Israel, the USA, and Britain are trying to create conflict in Iran as was done in the former Yugoslavia by creating problems along ethnic lines. This is called ‘balkanisation.’ The Israelis are doing this covertly through operations in Iraqi Kurdistan.

Propaganda for dividing and conquering people starts with definitions then the manipulation of history. I am an academic in the fields of anthropology and history and an Iranian from a minority group that is neither Persian nor Kurdish. I can tell you that Kurds are definitely ethnic Iranians in all senses from tradition to language, history, culture, identity, and genetics. I am alarmed by the current purging of internet articles that have hidden agendas trying to separate the Iranian identity of Kurds. 

As I was told by a Kurdish professor, Mr. Eskandari in Tehran: “Kurds are Iranian and the entity of Iran as a state and nation was founded by the [main] ancestors of the Kurds, the Mede who established Iran as an empire. One problem that has compounded the issue is that people misuse the term Persian and Iranian. Persians are Iranian, but all Iranians, like the Kurds and Ossetians, are not Persians.”

The Mede and other similar Iranian groups are the ancestors of the Kurds, but not the only group, just like how the ancient Persians are the main ancestors of the modern Persians, but not the only ancestors. Ancestors of Persians and Kurds also include Arabs, Mongols, and other Iranian peoples. 

I ask all the honest people on this site who wish to enhance knowledge not to take part in this fabrication of fact. There was a time when the Turkish government tried to convince Kurds that they were “Mountain Turks” and now there are powers at play that are either trying to disassociate the Kurds from their Iranian identity and origins or make whole generations of proud young Kurds forget or be unaware of their Iranian ethnicity. This is due to geo-strategic schemes. These forces are trying to victimize a whole group of people from knowing their own proud history and culture which is genuinely Iranian. The covert foreign policy of Israel, Britain, and America comes at the expense of the Kurds and even their history and culture.

I reorganized it, put in headings, added some wikilinks, deleted your signature (unlike blogs, Wikipedia editors don't sign articles), and took out some clear violations of WP:NPOV.  How is this stalking?  I haven't followed you around to any articles you have edited and vandalized them.  I don't recall how I came upon the article, my contributions list show it was just after some vandalism reverts  where I often find articles of interest, whether vandalized or not.

Many editors with blogging background don't realize that article listings for movies, books, theatre, etc. are not reviews.  Such quotes as, """"'The Intruder' contains William Shatner's best and bravest lead role, played to the hilt, and the hilt disappears into Adam Cramer,"""" are perfectly fine in a review, but not in Wikipedia.  You might want to read Wikipedia policy concerning original research.  If you can find similar sentiments in the print media or other such source, then, by all means, add it and reference it.  Don't worry about getting the format correct, put the information in the article and other editors will fix it up to conform to Wikipedia's manual of style.  You might want to look at other articles for movies to get a feel for the format.  Eventually, the """"original research"""" part of your contribution will be deleted.  If not by me, then by another editor.  I've found it better to anticipate that and write my articles accordingly.

Sorry, but I don't recall your comment, nor whether you are for or against deletion (although, I presume you took the opposite stance from me).  I read enough to get a feel for the arguments, did some research, and came to a decision.  In the past I have pushed delete and the articles were kept.

This isn't true at all, the only reason Franco worked with the western democracies was because Spain was in dire need of the supplies they could provide for Spain's weak economy, and later on, during the 50's and 60's, it was because Franco's advisors realized the need for Spain to take place in the burgeoning international economy.

 Unprotect on Černová tragedy 

Hi Ged.  I was recently looking around at indef. fully protected articles and seeing if there are any that might be eligible for unprotection.  I realize that Černová tragedy has a colorful history, but I wanted to get your thoughts on unprotection.  I don't have any edits to contribute, but I figure not all editors that want to contribute may know how to request edits to protected pages or request unprotection.  Additionally, perhaps further issues on this page could be addressed by semi-protection + blocks of socks?  You know more of the history than I which is why I put this here and not over at WP:RFPP.

 How Do Tornadoes Form? 

 Tornadoes form when the land is slightly damp and there is high winds. When there is a bad storm in the mountains you will often hear about Tornado Warnings. Not every storm turns into a tornado/twister.
 People know the Tornado as a Twister. You will hear people all around you say """"Twister."""" Do not be alarmed if you come across a tornado one day, just find a ditch and lay in it for awhile.

Discussing The Existence of “repulsion particle” And Its Significance              
Zhuang Yiliong
Shanghai Institute of Science and Technology Management

Abstract:This report has advanced a assume about the existence of  “repellention” by a kind of new idea. Beginning with this, I have explained more successfully some import theory questions in the area of the present physics, cosmology and philosophy ect. At same time a few of new reasons have been raised But this is only rough idea of physical philosophy. many key details need to be answered by the improving science in the future.
Key words: repulsion particle, the velocity of light, red shift, cosmos background.
  
　　　While the researched object of physics are increasingly getting its limit observed through the instrument, the function in the research of academic ideas are more important. In this article, only assumes the existence of a new particle, so it seems possible for many difficulty of physics and cosmology to be resulted. Maybe the key to unlock the door of advancing access of physics lies not in the building of physics, but in the palace of philosophy.

One、Grounds of advancing the existence of  “repulsion particle” 

Philosophic puzzles: gravity and repulsion, this is a pair of antiquated contradiction, theory of physics is a philosophic  lame. Angels said that the true theory  of matter should give the equal status to gravity and repulsion, the theory of matter only based on gravity is wrong, insufficiency and unilateral. Newton needed to find the first driving force for his physics, or else the world can’t act .
There is contradiction between Newton’s law of universal gravitation and Einstein’s mass-velocity expression. In the law universal gravitation, the magnitude of gravitation is direct proportional to mass of the matter, the bigger the mass is, the stronger the gravity is; while in the mass-velocity expression, with the speed of the matter increasing, the mass will add. If the “mass” of the two law is the same, then the speed of matter will increase, and the gravity will be stronger, the matter will be drawn too tighten to move by the gravity. But in fact, it’s just opposition, the shotted cannonball is incline to break loose the gravitation, provided that the speed is high enough, it is able to fly off the orbit of the earth, even the solar system. This shows that the mass of adding with the speed increasing is different with that works on the gravitation, because it manifest obviously a kind of repulsion confronting the gravitation.  So that, the two characteristics (speed increases, gravitation reduces; speed reduces, gravitation increases.) out while the state of moving matter changes .it is right to reflect the invert process between gravity and repulsion inside the moving matter , and indicate the existence of difference idiocratic mass.
Newton believed: falling of an apple is because of the function of gravitation, then, we can question in the opposition, how can the apple get to the top of the tree? If we block out all of the complicated growing process of all tree with black-box theory, and only consider the beginning and the ending state, then, in the opinion of physics, there must be a kind of universal repulsion fighting back the gravitation working on the apple and pushing it to the high place. Therefor, the universal repulsion should exist everywhere, as well as the universal gravitation.
What is the essence of “force”? This question has been disputing for hundreds of years, and it’s still not clear today. Newton said that it is the measurement of the acceleration of moving matter. But this only describes the force, not explains the essential mechanism. So, in Newton mechanics, the mass of  the moving matter is unchangeable. Einstein brought out the character that the mass of matter is changed with the speed. He thought the activity of matter is result from getting energy, while energy can agglomerate matter, and this character of this matter is the same as the original matter, so can be added, resulting that the mass of matter may trend to infinite with the speed increasing. If we can import a kind of repulsion to explain it, and give the energy a carrier of practicality, then, the relation of movement and the “force” will be more clear.
The radiant energy is always multiple of some elementary unit, what on earth is the physical meaning of Plank quantum constants? If it can be seen as a material particle, and indicate the existence of repulsion particle? Ray radiation has the two character of wave and particle itself. As to E=h*v, Plank regarded the radiant energy as constant h multiply frequency v from the site of wave theory; if, from the point of particle theory,  we can regard it as the h combination of v quantu",0,0,0,0,0,0

All three of these reports were vandalized off the article on me and replaced with a false claim from I think Chris Hillman that my co-worker Alexander Burinski in Moscow said that my formula

B(curved spacetime tetrad) = (hG/c^3)^1/2'd'(Goldstone Phase of Higgs Field)

was nonsense. Burinski refuted that false allegation allegedly made by Chris Hillman? Instead they let smears by alt.Kooks and other unqualified people stand in a prominent place and erased the above remarks by important physicists! Now that' the truth.

Now as to my Goldstone paper with Stoneham later head of Theoretical Physics, United Kingdom Atomic Energy Research Establishment, Harwell, Didcot, Berks (see photo in my autobiography """"Destiny Matrix"""" on Amazon. The American Institute of Physics in 1980 or so published a Resource Letter on Symmetry in Physics citing that paper as noteworthy.

You can ask Ray Chiao at Berkeley Physics Dept on how my laser filament paper influenced his early experiments. You can ask Creon Levit at NASA AMES about out oft-cited paper on applying Bohm's quantum potential to molecular structure computer simulations.

Nobel Prize physcist Brian Josephson has been similarly smeared like me because of his interest in the paranormal and cold fusion. Even John Wheeler has been smeared because he uses literate language and metaphor that rankles the hacks who can barely formulate a sentence and hide behind unreadable jargon. To say I use jargon is Pot calling Kettle Black. I am a much clearer writer than most.

Finally my paper explaining the universal slope of the Regge trajectories of the hadronic resonances as tiny Kerr black holes with strong short-range gravity G* ~ 10^40G on 1 fermi scale was published by Herbert Frohlich in 1973 in his journal """"Collective Phenomena"""". It caused Abdus Salam (Nobel Prize) to invite me to ICTP in Trieste, Italy 1973-74. You can ask historian of physics Jagdish Mehra about that. He was there. BTW I was tutored in group theory at Cornell by Robert Brout who I later met again in Brussels in 1973 when I visited Prigogine. Yuval Neeman and others in Israel are working still on this idea connecting QCD to strong short-range gravity. You can also ask Eshel Ben-Jacob head of the Israel Physical Society about me. No, Wikis for shame, for shame! This has been a vicious smear against me perhaps politically motivated because of my national security work. I do not know, but others may well find out. Also my adventures in the weird - paranormal, UFOs have been part of a long-standing covert intelligence operation involving American, British, French, Israeli and other Intelligence organizations.

9cd543951d0ce210,"Hazel Eye Myth==

The description of hazel eyes says they're green and brown (either colour could be dominant) and can also contain gold, this description is incorrect, true hazel eyes are a golden honey brown colour (basically light brown) which matches the colour of a golden brown hazelnut shell (hence the word hazel), however in some insatnces can contain minimal amounts of green (either on the outskirts and/or mixed in with the gold) when observed in direct/sun light, but green is by no means a requirement for true hazel eyes. 

The myth of hazel eyes being green and brown or any multi-coloured eye is common in North America and areas of the world that have been exposed to Americanisation, However in Europe (the origin of light eyes & hazelnuts) the correct meaning still exists and is used when identifying eye color (hazel eyes = golden light brown colour). The myth of hazel eyes being green and brown or any multi-coloured eye is likely to of started due to green and brown eyes turning a gold and/or light brown colour in areas of dim lighting and actual hazel eyes sometimes presenting slight green within the gold and/or on the outskirts when observed in direct/sun light, but this is nonetheless an obvious misconception which requires common sense to understand.

As for green and brown eyes they're well green eyes that contain contain central heterochromia (brown around the pupil) but this does not change the fact of their true colour being the outer green, if you want to categorise them differently the name Forest Green proves worthy or just simply green eyes with brown. 110.174.147.166

i would suggest to remove the passage about the mode of action of deet.this is speculaton and not proven. based on the NOR guidelines i cant say its wrong, but my data suggest that it might be not correct (blood substitute with ATP as sole attractant is also 'protected' by DEET (while there is no lactic acid...).   

Removed the """"natural alternatives"""" or actually added a question mark. Added refs to show that these """"alternatives"""" do not work. Also removed various distinctions between """"natural"""" and """"synthetic"""". There is no difference between a molecule synthesised chemically and naturally. Last: DEET is a repellant, NOT an insecticide.  

Made new page on DEET, using material gleaned largely from the CDC and EPA pages, and a couple of studies on health effects and insect-repellant effectiveness (from Google).  Although a bunch of the pages say one should be careful only to wear DEET when necessary, not under clothing, etc., they don't spell out why they're concerned.  I'm guessing DEET is chemically nasty (is it an organo-phosphate?), and so may have carcinogenic or other unfortunate properties.  If someone knows (and ideally can show) what these suspected effects might be, I think a short (hopefully rational) addition to the DEET page is called for.   15:03, 20 Oct 2003 (UTC)

What was Charlie Coll's contribution? Some Canadians think he invented the stuff.  22:13, 18 Aug 2004 (UTC)

Is it a poison? If so, what is the LD_50? Is it liquid or a gas or solid (at room temp and standard conditions)? Thanks.  

As mentioned in the article, its effect on the human body is not yet fully understood; it's ?gay? (eh? - Ed) and not an organophosphate (as seen from the chemical formula image) but the effect seen with leeches provides a clue as to what might happen if enough of it entered the body. The effect on leeches is added from my own experience, using a concentrated DEET stick (like a deodorant applicator) and only needing to touch the leech for it to convulse off. It's a liquid at rtp, as far as I can tell.  10:10, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)
Be careful adding from your own experience. That basically violates the Wikipedia:No original research policy. But that's simple to avoid, since if you've seen the effect, most likely someone else has. Wikipedia needs to be a secondary source, citing other published sources. So find a published source that finds the same thing, and the addition would be much better. Also it is liquid, as long as the repellant product bottles that say they are 100% deet really are. Also, just eyeballing from it's structure, liquid looks about right. I read a bunch of studies on DEET, and they all basically say it is safe as far as they can tell, but avoid overexposure as much as possible. A very small percentage of the time, some people (12 if I recall the study correctly, out of a large population) have a reaction to DEET. Basically the 60 years it has been used and the large amount of usage is strong evidence that at least the stuff is not really really nasty. So the article looks pretty accurate in that respect. -  Talk 12:00, Jun 13, 2005 (UTC)
Whoops, didn't know about that. Thanks. I'll leave it in for the moment and will try to remember to do backup research when I get home; if anyone believes that the information is unreliable enough please feel free to mark it out, and I'll just have to find a better source than word of mouth from my parents at the time ;)
Later: Researched. Found a fair bit of anecdotal evidence but not enough hard evidence to keep my previous addition in. Also a 1998 study shows DEET may actually accelerate absorption through the skin, so going to revert the edit. Putting in a link with lots of detail I found to make myself feel better ;)  16:38, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)

They are normally defined as topological manifolds with an atlas, whose transition maps are smooth, which is used to pull back the differential structure"""" (emphasis mine).  The point is not whether differentiable manifolds can be defined without an atlas (I already pointed out that they can also be defined with sheaves), but that the classical definition that most mathematicians are still using is the atlas definition. Markus is correct that the choice of an atlas for a topological manifold doesn't matter, but to be a manifold I will contend that it must have some atlas. Defining the sphere as a set of zeroes is implicitly embedding the sphere into another space. It has already been pointed out several times that a topological sphere does not have a unique differentiable manifold structure. How is the differentiable manifold structure induced by the embedding, and (more to the point) how can one understand the corresponding differentiable manifold structure on a topological sphere without mentioning this embedding? Topological spaces are not equipped with embeddings a priori. That a sphere with a differentiable manifold structure has a topological embedding into euclidean space does not at all imply that the differentiable structure was induced by this embedding. -

 Suggestions / Concerns 

Intro paragraph:
Ante Pavelić (14 July 1889 – 28 December 1959) was Croatian fascist leader,[1] revolutionist[2] and politician.[3] He ruled as Poglavnik[note 1] of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), a World War II puppet state of Nazi Germany in Axis-occupied Yugoslavia.[4] In the 1930s, he was a founding member and leader of the Croatian fascist[5] ultra-nationalist separatist movement, the Ustaše. In 1941, having been installed by the Axis occupation as leader of a Croat puppet state, he instituted a racial policy that led to genocide over hundreds of thousands of Serbs, Jews, and Roma in the NDH concentration camps, along with Croat political opponents and resistance members. At the end of the war, Pavelić escaped abroad. He died from wounds caused by an assassination attempt in Madrid on 28 December 1959.

Incorporating the term fascist is POV. Ante Pavelic was not the leader of Croatia's Fascist Party (one has never existed). The term puppet state is also POV, out of all the countries mentioned in the Eichmann trial, Croatia was the only one that a notable Nazi considered to be a sovereign republic. If we can not change the """"puppet state"""" tag, such information should be included because it would support the neutrality of this article. Axis-occupied Yugoslavia is also an irrelevant term as Yugoslavia did not defacto exist then (the one that was formed after the war was not the same as the one prior to, neither of them had defacto or dejure control) and today these regions have different names. If anything I would suggest that it be noted within Axis-Occupied Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina if anything. Saying that the Ustasa movement was installed is also POV. Hitler first wished to keep together Yugoslavia and tried to install Vladko Macek, which didn't happen. Slavko Kvatrenik declared Croatian independence prior to German's entering Zagreb and they simply accepted it. If the Ustasa movement was installed it couldn't have been by several parties at once, and if so, those parties would have recoginzed Croatia's independence that very day. Italy actually recognized Croatia a week or two before Germany did. The latter part about a racial party is nonsense. The Ustasa leadership instituted a Racial Policy towards only Jews. It should be noted that this Racial Policy was the only European anti-semitic policy that has unique notions granting special aryan status to Jews who supported the Croatian statehood cause prior to April of 1941. To say that Pavelic escaped is also misleading because ally special service agencies knew where he was the whole time.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

User#24.168.66.27, Please don't delete my posts.  That is very rude.

The following was deleted by user#24.168.66.27 this morning.  Why would he delete this post, I wonder:

If anyone is curious, in the interests of creating a NPOV article about surrealism, it should be noticed that both user#63.169.104.2 and user#24.168.66.27 were the main users interested in pushing the Keith Wigdor article forward. If you have any doubts, then check the discussion page for that article.
    
It wasn't long ago that all references to """"Keith Wigdor"""" were removed from this """"surrealism"""" article. This removal occured because of Wigdor's total unimportance to the surrealist movement, for the simple reason that Keith Wigdor is, at best, an emerging digital artist who fancies himself as a being a surrealist, and who has many times attempted to pose as a surrealist. Needless to say, many of the english-speaking surrealist groups listed on this page know about him and refuse to have anything to do with him. Keith Wigdor appears again and again to disrupt all things genuinely surrealist.  
 
It is also interesting to note, if you check the discussion archives of this """"surrealism"""" article, that these same 2 users were also involved with promoting Keith Wigdor as a surrealist, in this very article. Also, if you look at some of the recent, belligerent, trollish, thike-ish posts of these 2 users, it shouldn't be unreasonable to suspect that perhaps both of these 2 IP numbers are being used by Keith Wigdor.

For the 2 no-name users mentioned here, who are strongly associated with or strongly correlated with the antics of Keith Wigdor, it is difficult to imagine that their efforts in building this wiki article will be anything but disruptive and manipulative in the long run. Please treat these 2 users with extreme caution, for they are one and the same, and also happen to be Keith Wigdor, who is playing a sock-puppet game.  22:10, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)""",0,0,0,0,0,0

For example, the subsection on Fauna is linked to a larger and more detailed article on the fauna of this national park. Another example is the article on Buckingham Palace. The subsection on The Garden and the Mews has a Main link to an article specifically dealing with the Buckingham Palace garden. In Sustainability, this is not the case, and there is often redundancy: for example, Main link points to acid rain and climate change when in fact that subsection already has those articles embedded in the text.

9d5626371a93681e,"Vandalism etc report against User:Signalhead

I'm not sure why it was incorretly made but I reproduce it here as requested.

I wish to make an allegation of persistent Vandalism against the owner of the account ‘Signalhead’ for repeated vandalism of articles, to which: deletion of material edited into those articles which Signalhead disagrees with their being there, such contributions being legitimate edits and not vandalism in themselves (other than Signalhead unilaterally deciding that he doesn't want them there).

The articles in question are on a railway subject matter and it is clear that Signalhead has unilleterally appointed himself as an ‘expert’ who has decided to ‘own’ the articles and persistently arbitrates on what material may or may not be edited into the article.  I refer in particular to three articles, 'Home Signal'; ‘Token (Railway Signalling)’ and ‘Signal Passed at Danger’ (And I must thank Signalhead himself for providing the evidence of that last article where he tried to use a claimed erroneous edit as evidence of a false claim of sockpupetry – it has become clear that another contributor (or even contributors) feel the same way I do).

Whenever edits are made to those articles, Signalhead has often just deleted (vandalism:blanking) the edit claiming the information is just wrong or ‘erroneous’ without permitting any discussion on the point.  Further the blanking takes place anything from a few minutes to a few hours which clearly demonstrates that Signalhead is watching the articles to make sure that no ‘unsuitable’ material is placed there and to ensure that he can delete any material which he believes is incorrect.  This demonstrates an arrogant ‘know it all’ attitude to other Wikipedia contributors and is, against the principles on which Wikipedia is based.  This unacceptable behaviour brings wikipedia into disrepute by discouraging legitimate contributors from actually contributing to the content of articles.

For my own part, I specifically refer to Signalhead’s blanking of an edit at 16:44 on the 15th September to article ‘Token (railway signalling)’, with an edit summary of ‘Removed Erroneous comments …’ because he thinks he knows better (vandalised within 4 hours).  Signalhead also vandalised the article ‘Home Signal’ at 11:42 27th October 2007 when he blanked an edit from another contributor in the article with the familiar ‘Reverted erroneous edit’ justification, within 3 hours of the contribution, again because he claimed to know better.  I reverted this blanking when I added an illustration that supported the blanked text.  However, Signalhead just vandalised the article again by blanking the edit at 17:07 on the 27th October 2007 with a ‘Reverted to earlier and better version’ justification, less than 2 hours after the restoration.  Signalhead did add something to the article discussion page, but regardless of that he had no right to just blank the contribution no matter how much of an authority he thinks he may be on the subject matter.  He should have discussed the matter first and then the article should have been adjusted by consensus.

I note that another contributor has also expressed exasperation with Signalhead's persistent blanking and adjudication of article content in a somewhat more unorthadox manner.

I offer the short times between contribution and blanking and the blanking itself as evidence that Signalhead is watching ‘his’ articles and deleting any ‘unsuitable’ (in his eyes) content.

With Signalhead’s apparent familiarity of finding his way around Wikipedia, I find it hard to believe that he is unaware of the rules.

I must therefore insist that Signalhead’s editing rights be permanently revoked for the following reasons.

1.TABPersistent blanking of other contributors edits which constitutes persistent vandalism.

2.TABArroganct contempt towards other Wikipedia contributors by adopting an attitude that he knows better than everyone else (which is a clear abuse of those contributors).  Even to the extent of making false allegations to detract from his own violation of the rules.

3.TABAdopting a self appointed role of deciding what can and can’t be contributed to articles which he has decided to ‘own’ and thus …

4.TABActing in a manner to bring Wikipedia into disrepute.",0,0,0,0,0,0

I do not think the link is one to be treated as vandalism, which I am sorry must be common in any article about a well-known leader.  The subject matter of the linked article does not seem to be concerned with expression of a particular point of view on race (if this is what """"racist"""" means): if it did it would not be relevant to the MLK page.  But it does seem to be biographical, has some nice photographs, and is well-written and reasonable, and therefore of interest.  As an experienced (non-American, with no point of view on the subject of the article) contributor to wikipedia, I believe a variety of appropriate links to a subject is of interest, and contributes to understanding.  And a variety of independent views expressed of a subject enriches, and is the way to approach the truth, like any scientific research: it is not for editors to filter links because they contain matter showing the subject to be less than perfect - we are all human - and I can understand that this might be the reason.

Enough.  Please can there be viewpoints on the relevance of the link to MLK ?  And consensus.  Welcome from the editor mentioned above and others.  Thanks.    
We don't link to fringe sites such as AmRen without a very good reason, and there isn't one here; the article in question is an opinion piece by a non-notable grad student, and is of no particular value to the article. Sorry you don't like the term """"racist"""", but it's an appropriate description for Amren. This article gets a vast amount of racist vandalism  that's why it's semi-protected  and non-vandalism pointing to racist sources is immediately and properly suspect. ∇∆∇∆ 15:""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 criticism of jesus/plucking eyeballs out/slavery 

Jesus has been criticized as vindictive, intolerant, prudish, and unkind. Several scholars have noted that he appears to condone slavery.
 
−TABTAB 
−TAB
The cardinal Avery Robert Dulles stated that Jesus “said not a word against slavery as a social institution"""", and believes that the writers of the New Testament did not oppose slavery either.  In his paper published in Evangelical Quarterly, Kevin Giles notes that Jesus often encountered slavery, """"but not one word of criticism did the Lord utter against slavery,” and argues that Jesus must have then condoned it.  
 
−TABTAB 

How come the Catholic removed this section in his words """"because it didn't appear to be criticism"""" is this a joke?  
−TAB
Friedrich Nietsche argued that “a war was declared on passion” in the Sermon on the Mount, in which Jesus says of sexual temptation: """"If thy eye offend thee, pluck it out."""" According to Nietsche, “Destroying the passions and cravings, merely as a preventive measure against their stupidity and the unpleasant consequences of this stupidity, today this itself strikes us as merely another acute form of stupidity. We no longer admire dentists who """"pluck out"""" teeth so that they will not hurt any more…. the Christian who follows that advice and believes he has killed his sensuality is deceiving himself: it lives on in an uncanny vampire form and torments in repulsive disguises.”[Friedrich Nietzsche, 1878, Human all too Human: A Book for Free Spirits, The Wanderer and His Shado, aphorism 83] """,1,0,0,0,0,0

If you doubt the scientific consensus, the page on the Saturated fat and cardiovascular disease controversy is already well written and covers the """"controversy"""" well.  Any rejection of scientific and medical consensus should really be kept there, rather than spread across Wikipedia (Cholesterol skepticism, not unlike the similar anti-vaccination position, is not credible and poses a public health risk when it results in misinformation).
I also clarified the point about Cholesterol, regarding hyper-responders, and included a link (if anybody has a better link or can go into more detail for readers, that might be good).

Hi there. This is . I was just notified that you E-mailed  whom I met on Wikipedia and told him that I'm a 35-year-old-man. I'm curious where you got that information. The last time I checked, I was a fifteen-year-old girl. Tell me honestly: If I was a thirty-five-year-old man, where would I be pretending to be a teenage girl  on Wikipedia, or on a cybersex chat?

If you're still not convinced, feel free to Google my username (purplefeltangel) or my E-mail address (bizzaleth@rogers.com). You'll find information dating back years, most of it consistent,. Where it isn't, it's because I avoided using my real name or faked my age to get by COPPA.

My mom even has a blog. I've been on the Internet since I was eight  that's seven years, by the way, and in all that time there has never been any evidence that I'm not who I say I am. I've had voice conversations with many people and exchanged letters with others. Do you think I'd be able to pull all that off?

These kinds of accusations are not only hurtful, but libellious  and just plain mean. Didn't your mother ever teach you to think twice before you spread gossip?

Before you get defensive, please just tell me who told you this. I don't want to start trouble, just avoid any that this might cause me. You might even be able to give the information I've just given you to whomever started this rather nasty rumour.

I'm not sure I get your point.  Readers of Wikipedia aren't required to be familiar with all of its policies and guidelines, and so it can't be assumed that they will know about the notability requirements, which are in fact only a guideline.  Moreover, there are plenty of organizations which don't go out of their way to publicize themselves yet are still notable, and aggrandizing connotates way more than just publicity.  Including 'self-aggrandizing' doesn't at all suggest that that's their primary motive.  As well, there could be notable trolls or notable trolling groups who don't self-aggrandize, and certainly not to the extent and in the joie de vire manner the GNAA does.  Indeed, many trolling groups and individuals try to obscure or hide the fact that they're trolls, which often makes their activities more successful.

It is wrong because the section of the Manual of Style on section headings explicitly says (in the last bullet point):
""""If there are no blank lines above the heading, one line should be added, for readability in the edit window."""" [emphasis mine]
Your continual removal of this blank line appears to be based on a misinterpretation of the Headings and sections section of the Manual of Style page on Layout, which states:
""""Between sections, there should be only a single blank line; multiple blank lines in the edit window create too much white space in the article.""""
It is obvious from both the previous quotation and last sentence of this one that the instruction """"there should only be a single blank line"""" is referring to the layout in the edit window and not that of the finally rendered page.
It is not at all obvious to me that the aircraft specification template is broken. The bug which produces the extra newline could well be in the rendering software rather than the template itself. But in any case, since your removal of the single blank line in the edit window is contrary to the style guidelines, I shall revert it.  Please do not revert again without giving a more substantial reason than you have so far offered for doing so.

 This is the last time I am going to tell you: Stop vandalising and stop disturbing me 

Family names are a valid article. Each family name in every language can be an article. Instead of your Serbophobic (and therefore racist, since you are apparently Korean, at least that is what you claim) vandalism edits, go and do something useful like making wiki articles for Korean family names. Most certainly do not ever again take the liberty to tell me what to do, because you have neither right nor authority to do that and your snotty and inappropriate comments are unwelcome.

Eventually, as I have already replied at the ludicrous discussion you started  where, BTW, no one took your side  I will create longer pages for each individual family name when I have time. They will be full articles in their own right. For now, leave the Serbian family names alone and do not input vandalism redirects to specific people. People are people and they have their own article and names are names and they have their own articles AS NAMES, not as incidental necessity for redirection. 

Further your comparison with the family name """"Hitler"""" is absolutely abhorrent, as all people who had that family name have changed it after WW II, so that family name does indeed relate to only a signe person. And even so, it would still be possible to write an article about the family name as such, but it's not my interest, so I won't do it.

Solid genealogical study of Melungeon ancestry overwhelmingly leads to a simple conclusion. The primary genetic makeup of Melungeons - that which gives them their Melungeon physical characteristics - comes from certain Native American tribal genetic lines. Careful genealogical research, working backward from universally accepted Melungeons, shows their ancestral lines go back to Native Americans. The truth may not be as exciting as having an unsolved conundrum but the truth is that Melungeons almost certainly are descendants of the intermarriage of Native Americans with old-world colonists. This isn't an opinion. This is a scientific conclusion. They aren't Portuguese. They aren't Turks. They are Native Americans.""""  The Melungeon Mystery Solved by James S. Elder

Real Restructuring of Article to Explicate POVs

Re-reading the article itself, looking through pages of Search results on violence,  ’s comments on perceptions,  and looking at how the Terrorism article dealt with similar POV problems, I realize the whole article needs restructuring per the below and will do so in next few days after comments.  Honest dealing with POVs is all I am interested in -)  Will proceed during weekend.

OUTLINE:

''Violence is the exertion of physical force so as to injure or abuse. The word is used broadly and may describe the destructive action of natural phenomena like storms and landslides damaging physical things, accidental or intentional human destruction of property or injury to persons, or intentional psychological harm to those living under constant threat of physical abuse and/or verbal and emotional abuse.

Call Sign Meaning
I've been adding WISconsiN as a call sign meaning for quite some time now only to have it deleted by another user who INSISTS that the only possible meaning for the calls is the defunct WISconsin News newspaper.  As far as I know, there is no official documentation or credible source that states that the calls are a reference to the newpaper and the newspaper ALONE.  So who's to say the calls weren't also chosen because it was an abbreviation of the state's name?  There's plenty of examples of a station using calls with multiple meanings (such as WBBM-TV out of Chicago).  But my main sticking point is that WISN has referenced the calls while advertising itself as """"WISconsiN TV"""" (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JFirQUXfc8)  My theory is that the station chose to keep the calls after the newspaper folded because they referenced the state's name as well (the station had only been using the calls for a few years when the paper folded, so the """"name recognition"""" argument is moot).  But regardless of why they kept the calls, I think the fact that the station made a conscious decision to use them to brand itself as """"Wisconsin TV"""" deserves mention.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

That being said, mike, the phrase """"the magnitude of the regression, across varying degrees of relatedness"""" isn't quite on the mark.  What Jensen did was show that not only does the IQ gap exist in itself, but that the populations regress towards the same differentiated means as found in the IQ gap.  It basically reinforces the claim that the IQ gap is a real effect.  now, he and Nesbitt argue over whether that regression is better explained by genetic or environmental theories (and in fact Jensen's structural equation model suggests that both genetics and environment play a role), but that issue has not been decided yet.

Take Swift Stern Action against this guy

Hi Sue,

Long time. How are you?

I visit wikipedia only occasionally these days.

I just came across this: 

I think you should give Crossmr a stern warning of NPA and CIVIL on his talk page and I think you should remove that despicable PA and uncivil comment(check out the heading/edit of the comment /edit summary /etc.) from royaa's talk page. Or let me know if I should personally give him that warning and remove that despicable comment myself. I would be happy to do that. Thanks.

It seems that Crossmr is acting with a malicious instigative agenda. He keeps rambling on about old things and keeps repeating himself (and his instigations) about them. It seems that he is unable to move on, and let peace reign, and is hung up on old already-settled bloated issues, not to mention non-issues. He seems to want to live in the past.
And to think that this guy goes around placing warnings of CIVIL and NPA on other user's talk pages. Talk about missing the plank for the speck. Tsk tsk. LOL. He should pay attention to his own Block Log  and history!!!!! lol.

He also needs to learn properly about AGF and pipe down.

His ill-intended comments are obviously malicious and deliberately provocative. But instead of me being provoked, he only serves to amuse me. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. But it has to be made clear to him that his uncivil rants are totally unacceptable and will not be tolerated. I think coming from an admin will make him, a general user, understand better.

Thanks and regards. )

I think the answers to these questions are unfortunately a bit muddled.  Initially I was going to say that the Public Relations Officers who wrote those articles may have inserted the term without thinking (or knowing).  However one possibility is that since ISAF is a reaction to the Bonn Agreement, it may be considered peacekeeping with the parties including the fledgling national government and the various quasi-legitimate warlords.  But the Taliban and Al-Qaeda are not parties to any agreement.  To my understanding, without an agreement in place between sides, there is no peacekeeping.  """"Security Assistance"""" (the SA in ISAF) to me is a subset of the military term """"peace support operations"""" (peacekeeping is another subset of peace support operations).  In the end, I think the NATO and ISAF webpages must be authoritative, and I have seen no mention of the term """"peacekeeping"""" on any of the main documents I have looked at.  I don't claim to be an authority, and soldiers (and bureaucrats, and politicians) argue about the meaning of words all the time, but to me 'peacekeeping' has a specific meaning that ISAF does not fit.

I would go a different way: The famous musicians (or their fans) who accused him should show their sources (they have the advantage of being alive and are able to defend themselves against accusations). It would make more sence to me to write about the obvious racism of Chuck D and Mary Blidge and a lot of other famous people than about Elvis' non-exixting racism. I think it's is unfair to the music and cultural impact of Elvis that such things got too much space in the article and other much more essential aspects of Elvis did not get mentioned. I think people who are interested in the person and music of Mary Blidge or Chuck D should discuss it on the discussion site of their articles in wikipedia. They should find out if there is racism or not. Or maybe start an article """"racism in showbussiness"""" and dicuss it there. I think you should not let  it become your problem that some people (for instance Chuck D and Blidge obviously) have problems with 1.Elvis being white , 2.the fact that he was from the rural south, 3.that they believe what other people say only because they share a similar pigmentation and repeat it without checking out any sources or 4.that they wanted get simply attention. By the way - Do you think this musicians ever heard one of  A. Crudup's or Kokomo Arnold's songs or even Roy Brown? I think you could write that Elvis was target of racism and accused of being a racist and mentioning some source and footnotes. But for an article about Elvis it is too detailed the way it is. I think give Elvis credit for what he did - positive and negative - and not for what he did not do.

About Elvis meeting the Beatles: Okay they met and there was no chemistry between them. Did it have any impact on Elvis? He did not like the Beatles before and not after they met. It is another anecdote from Elvis' view. But I think it would be worth reading in a article about the Beatles or John Lennon. He meant much more to them than the other way around (positive or negative). I only gave details about the meeting I've read in a german book which proably was not published in english language. It shows a very negative behavior of Elvis and I wished he would have act different but the sources are that way and having the Beatles Anthology on dvd I could see and hear  Ringo Starr telling the story (only McCartney was very, very kind, maybe even a little bit white washing).

I would like to know what you think about my comments about Berry, Perkins, Kokomo Arnold etc.. I think it tells something about the accusation of stealing music. Heard several years ago an interview with Dave Bartholomew when he played in Switzerland where he said he listened with Fats Domino to many songwriters black and white, blues and country, and he bought the best songs, arranged and changed them and put his name (and Dominos) under it. He said that was common and he knew from some former Ellington musicians that the Duke did the same. 87.162.47.181   Franco, Deutschland

It is important to mention that most people thought Hitler had killed himself in the bunker long before the Russian archives were opened (for example The World at War episode """"21.

I added the sentence with cadaver to the article back in May 2006, one of the advantages of using the word cadaver was that as a summary of a source I used it removed any possibility that it was [[wp:plagiarism|plagiarism], and another advantage is it is accurate.

I am failing this article because it has two major issues: referencing and image use. You need references for the comic's censorship, especially, since that is a potentially controversial claim, but also throughout the history section. On image use, we have one free image, which is great, but we also have one non-free image with no rationale, and neither image is being used informatively within the article. Since fixing these issues will require searching out additional sources (usually time-consuming) and possibly substantial rearrangement of the article format, I'm going with a fail rather than a hold.

I can *reach* the outer limits of the larger range but I can't sustain pitch accuracy or handle any considerable length of melody. Again, regardless of her range, she's proved many times over that she is effective in most of her range. Vision Of Love remains one of the most remarkable vocal performances I've ever heard. I'd love to hear her sing some of Hildegard von Bingen's music, she's probably the only popular singer who could actually do it with ease. Btw, Billie Holiday was one of the greatest singers yet her full range not broad - some say only about an octave and a half - and she packs more meaning and soul into her renditions than most better-endowed voices. Range is no determinate of anything but boundary conditions, the real news is what gets done within the given range, of course. Again, I think MC is simply phenomenal in that regard. Oh, one word more re: range and I'm gone: Captain Beefheart is also said to have had an enormous vocal range. I love his music too, but he was no MC. )

 Racism, Noble savage, Orientalism and Araby 

No flaming intended, I just want balance to come to this subject.  Explain to the world, how putting Greek homosexuals on a pedestal, is in any way, shape, or form, NPOV.  You know, Greek scholars on the matter paint homosexuality in a different hue than outsiders who romanticize the subject (e.g. Oliver Stone's Alexander (film)).  They see homosexuality as existing all over the world and in all eras.  To portray Ancient Greece as some buggery paradise is prejudiced and ignorant, just as if they were all claimed to be paragons of heterosexual machismo.  Gay Greeks are your Wandering Jew.  Whenever I watched Hercules: The Legendary Journeys and Xena: Warrior Princess, homosexuality did not come to mind.  Perhaps the slash fiction community would rather Hercules and Xena """"get nasty"""" with their traveling companions, but that's beside the point.  You can't always have it to your fantasy or ideal, simply by calling other people """"narrow"""".  So far, you've succeeded in stereotyping Greeks as rabid homosexuals.

The question of head winds. Both the last forecast sent to Earhart and Noonan and their reported conditions agree. It is most likely that they were encountering headwinds as high as 23 knots. It is also certain from her reports that they had climbed considerably above the optimum altitudes early in the flight and thus had to have had considerable additional fuel consumption. I would  refer you to Kelly Johnson's instructions prepared for Earhart on the flight profile necessary to achieve optimum range. Given the variables which we cannot know, I would imagine that she had 1-2 hours reserve by the time she reached the vicinity of Howland - but that might be optimistic. I cannot know how much fuel she had. One radio log indicates she stated 1/2 hour (but did that include the remainder of 100 octane?). One thing for certain is that she did state she was """"low on fuel"""" and that cannot be reasonably interpreted as meaning she was """"fat."""" This is OPINION, but given the anxiety she seemed to have in her voice and her use of the term 'low on fuel,"""" coupled with the forecast and reported (by her) winds, it is probable that they were far less than the optimum 4-5 hours given still air and best altitude operations would have made possible.

Mr. Gillespie can dismiss her report of ground speed and winds aloft as well as the far higher than optimum altitude she reported less than half way into the flight with the term """"speculation"""" (in a foot note). No one did at the time, nor can I. (OPINION- but) Though this is my Opinion, I CAN document several aspects of it including  the airplane designers instructions and how his instructions for an optimum profile differed from her report. Her reports and how they coincided with the last forecast the USN sent her from Hawaii. And thus how if Kelly Johnson was right, True had not incompetently read the information about winds aloft from reporting stations near her path, and she was not lying; then she MUST have had significantly higher fuel consumption than the optimum profile would have produced. How much, that is a question I cannot specifically answer. But for all three to be totally wrong, for there have been still air, for True to have been incompetent in his interpretation of winds aloft reports, and Earhart to have been lying about the """"winds"""" she reported and her """"speed"""" takes a bit of """"speculation"""" I cannot indulge in. Mistakes were made, but I can't imagine everyone made exactly the right combination of mistakes and deceptions to allow the Electra to have achieved it's optimum performance on the flight. Given the time which they apparently (from reports and signal strength) spent searching  for Howland Island, it is unlikely that they had a big reserve when the last signal was heard (OPINION).

Prameswara is indeed a common Sanskrit name. Prameswara is also incontrovertibly Indonesian, whether he was Sumatran or Javanese  is unclear- but he was definitely born in Sumatra int the court of Sriwijaya- not as the article states, in Temasek- which would make Prameswara a fisherman's child.
Islam arrived in Indonesia from Persia, Punjab and Gujarat- not China. Zheng He was a Hamafi muslim, not a Sufi. The earliest Muslim graves in Java proper date from 1368 (Banten) -1400 in Trowulan, the capital of Majapahit in the same complex as the cenetries of the highest nobility- which indicates the highest strata of Javanese society had already began to convert, predating the Eunuch Turkoman Hamafi Zheng He. Thus the ludicrous argument CHinese as part of the Wali Songo brought Islam to Java is disproved by archeological evidence.

You will also note- the Javanese repelled the Mongols- the only other Asians to successfully do so were the Japanese. Zheng He's navy was a navy for prestige and tribute- not a military navy. The Javanese under Singhasari later Majapahit also repelled the Siamese, and the Negerakertagama epoic already indicates there was Muslim activity or unrest in pre-Zheng He Java. I have not read of any Zheng HE military campaign.

 Re the surname Rossi Lemeni. 

         I could cite many hyphen less articles, covers,  posters etc for Rossi Lemeni.   La Scala certainly set off hyphen less - as here for example  La Scala Milan Verdi, Messa da Requiem conducted 
         by Victor de Sabata 27 Gennaio 1951.   Record sleeves """"Grandi Voci alla  Scala"""" ,   """"Il Barbiere di Siviglia""""  La Scala Milan IDIS 6479/80,   """"Anna Bolena""""  La Scala Milan MYTO historical live,
         and the published poetry  """"AMICO"""" etc is without the hyphen, so your argument, whilst obviously with foundation, is not nearly as overwhelming as you make out. 

         However, as you are clearly totally opposed to this alteration would you accept, at very least for the sake of clarification and information for your readers, mention of the unhyphenated name
         in the body of the text, perhaps worded as  """"legal name Nicola Rossi Lemeni Makedon and stage name Nicola Rossi Lemeni,  to which record companies and publicists have sometimes added a hyphen."""" 

         -  or would you delete that contribution?

Since the partial control by the Ottoman, Nakhichevan and Erivan served as depots of goods, intermedary from the Ouest and East, Persia even further pushed that but replaced the Armenians who would rather trade on the Shah's capital. You claim having provided data, but you have provided absolutly nothing, because the only things you have provided, even before I covered them, and what you present in no way contradict what you claim. A projection of that much people (250-300,000), to claim that Tartars at least presented that much in the Western zone, would have been just sensless.

What I have provided.

1-That there were reasons specifically targetting Armenians which do not apply and were not applied to Muslims.

2-I have provided materials excluding the Muslims in reference to the depopulation.

3-I have provided materials equating the population with the word Armenian.

4-I have provided a reference prior to Gultestan Treaty, and you dismissed the author, while in Wikipedia we only present sources and if there exist critics from notable published materials of those sources. What you think of the author is original research.

You answered by presenting 13-14th century and post Gulestan materials, which in no way have I contested nor do they contradict what I have been saying. I have provided figures of Armenian moved, which by projection represent 2 million or more Armenians if projected for 1918, and those excludes the recorded numbers of Armenians who escaped depopulation and inspite of it, there still remained a considerable number of Armenians pre Gulestan, which I also documented. I have documented everything I have been claiming, you request things that do not exist, because there was no Nakhochevan delimitation in that period, nor statistics for a bordering which is quite modern in comparaison to Abbas period.

In short, what you have highlighted is that the word Armenian has no place in this article, and that you have no intention to improve it. You know that what you propose is misleading but you still claim it is neutral. As we speak 98% of Nakhichevan population is Azeri, so claiming depopulation could only be misleading in that it suggest that Azeris were those moved when the Armenians were those mostly affected. Obviously here, we do have a problem, and as it appears, you in no way want to correct it.  (ix)",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Perpetual Virginity

Certainly some people believe these assertions, but they don't belong in an article that presents the Roman Catholic Church's Marian dogmas.

The article also says that: """"Mary did break her vow by the grace of God.""""  The writer seems to mean that God gave Mary a free pass to have sex but remain a virgin.  That really needs a citation, because I've never heard anything like it.  The RC Church teaches that Mary was really and truly a virgin her whole life, and other people believe she had sex and bore children, but as far as I know, no one teaches that she had sex, but God was okay with it, so we call her a virgin anyway.

 Words and their meaning 

Like your confusion over the meaning of """"homophobia"""", Bugs, you've shown by your comments about """"homicide"""" on WP:ANI that you don't seem to understand how the English language actually works.

The most obvious thing is to point out that prefixes and suffixes (like """"homo/homi"""" and """"cide"""") are NOT governed by fixed rules maintained by some authority. Secondly, even given generally observed rules as to the meanings of certain prefixes and suffixes, actual usage  whether intentional on the part of the coiner, definitional drift, or simply by being idioms  determines actual meanings. Finally, for actual legal terms, those ARE given specific definitions which may or may not match """"logical"""" combinations, your impressions, or even popular usage. For the last one, I'll point you to the Cornell University School of Law:

Homicide is when one human being causes the death of another. Not all homicide is murder, as some killings are manslaughter, and some are lawful, such as when justified by an affirmative defense, like insanity or self-defense. 

This is Wikipedia, Bugs: words mean what reliable sources say they mean, not what you'd like them or how you've work them out in your mind to mean. If you're going to proclaim you understand the meaning of word, you need to check first.  | Talk 
Your opinion has been noted and logged. ← What's up, Doc? carrots→ 
Without affirmation that Bugs doesn't seem to know how the English language works (that's a bit strong, imo), he is right for 99% of the time that the word homicide is used. My input here, to be helpful, is that I have seen the death certificates of state-executed convicts which are correctly labeled """"homicide"""" as the cause of death. It is rare but does affirm that homicide does not always mean murder. —  (talk)

Some of this discussion seems to have gotten a little heated, but I think the main goal remains the same of having a good encylopedia and having good articles within it. The subjects involved, both MHFM and the others mentioned - may seem obscure to the general reader but are figures of note within the theological/philsophical schools of which they represent. The sedevacantist position is of serious interest to those studying the ramifications of Vatican II on the largest single religious denomination on the planet, and stands as a serious challenge to those who accept Vatican II and those who refuse and resist it (such as the Society of Saint Pius X) but still hold that Francis is a legitimate Pope (despite his endorsement of Vatican II). Due to the sedevacantist rejection of contempory Vatican authority it makes sense that there are competing schools within this segment of post Vatican II Catholicism, and in a culture obsessed with concerns such as """"What will Amanda Bynes tweet next?"""" it stands to reason that they are paying much attention to debates over things like the rubrics of the tridentine rite. But it would be a disserve to the goal of the encyclopedia to ignore these intellectual schools of thought. Surely if wikipedia can have an article on every piece of music made by Paris Hilton, we can find a way to capture the interactions and debates between schools of thought that will continue for generations to come. 

It is Wikipedia practice to use a person's published thoughts as a legitimate source that can be cited as a quotation about that person's opinion...i.e. a person's tweets can be quoted in that person's wikiarticle (citing the twitter page's url) even though they are were not printed in full by a media organization. It would seem that such an approach could be used here citing Ibranyi by quoting his online work as an indication of his own thought, as long as an encylopedic manner was maintained.174.53.163.243  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Infoboxes 

Hi, I see you have changed infoboxes for Beverley & Market Weighton to infobox settlement. But can you please explain how this change fits in with our WP:UKCITIES standard which states """"All settlements of the United Kingdom (that are not coterminous with a local government district) are to use the Template:Infobox UK place, though some very rare exceptions exist. For those that are coterminous with a local government district (which are usually large cities / unitary districts or equivalent—such as Liverpool, Leicester, and Bristol), please use Template:Infobox settlement.""""

As for as I can determine we should be using the UK Infobox for these places not the settlement box.

  

The coat of arms added to the infobox for Beverley is not current and so should not be in the article as far as I can see.  

 Edit war and the three revert rule 

May I make you aware that the three revert rule prohibits users restoring material more than 3 times in a rolling 24 hour period. You appear to be engaged in an edit war at Beverley and are not contributing to discussion but enforcing preferences upon articles that others object to.  |  Talk   

I had a right to remove this as you do not have a consensus. Four editors have commented they do not want that infobox, whilst you have continued to revert to it. I will be reporting you for breach of 3RR (despite a warning), which may see you loose your editting privlidges. I'm also displeased with your edit summmaries and comments on talk pages which appear to be disparaging.  |  Talk   

I've reported you for 3RR. However, at this stage I must also express my concern about your comments at Talk:Market Weighton and your edits to Manchester which are incivil and distruptive respectively. This does nothing but harm Wikipedia and harm your reputation.  |  Talk   

PS please re-read WP:UKCITIES (not WP:CITIES as you keep referring to). Manchester has the distinction of being a local government district, whereas Selby etc do not. UKCITIES states that local government district ONLY should use Template:Infobox settlement. However, don't take this up with me, please resume debate at Talk:Beverley to achieve a way forwards.  |  Talk   

I think at this stage you're likely to incur a much greater block on your account as well as bring more attention to your editting style. Remember, do not distrupt Wikipedia to make a point. Your edits to Manchester are not in good faith and starkly so (you are gaming false claims of consensus). Have you not considered what maturity and respectabiliy level appears? I do not believe you are being conductive to the good of the project and I suspect you would agree. Why not rethink your approach?  |  Talk

 stubbing the article 

I've stubbed this article (removed nearly all content) because the content completely fails to meet wikipedia's standards and needs a total rewrite. Among the issues are:
Copyright issues/plagiarism. Significant portions of the article are lifted from . See WP:CP. Examples include: """"Because participants were policed, punished, or rewarded by each other, a unique camaraderie exists towards the very individuals who inflicted the torment."""" """"Given the 20 years required for the memories to resurface, and the additional sequelae of PTSD, only a fraction are beginning to seek and receive successful treatment for their trauma.""""
The article is completely biased and presents only one side of the story. By searching through news articles I found that while there were many allegations of abuse, the program was also praised by significant figures including two US presidents. This is absent from the article. The organization and its treatment method is described completely from the point of view of the critics. See WP:OR
The use of sources is very bad. Instead of mainstream news or academic sources, there are references to """"Cannabis Culture"""" and to websites run by self-described survivors of the program. A great deal of information is completely unsourced. In certain cases - for instance the link to WCPO - the sources do not seem to actually say what the article indicates that they say.
Some very serious allegations are completely uncited. See WP:NPOV.
The extent to which this article violates wikipedia policy is shocking. This post, as well as other posts on the article's talk page lead me to believe that the article's editors have a clear conflict of interest and an agenda. That's not acceptable.

I'm highly amazed by the fact that this debate rages on. If I may interject, Aleta formed a subsection entitled Arbitrary Page Break. Note using the word Arbitrary over say, Random? Are we going to throw a huge fuss over the inclusion of a more sophisticated word? Sobriquet is quite clearly at least somewhat different from Nickname, otherwise there would be only one article encompassing both words. My suggestion is per a growing trend on Wikipedia: Link sobriquet to a definition in Wiktionary, should one exist. This saves readers the hassle of going through an entire article trying to summarily grasp the full definition of one word within an article comprised of several thousand such words. Furthermore, if Wikipedia is meant to be an informal learning tool of sorts, why fear incorporating a higher grade-level vocabulary into it as a means of providing the best possible learning experience? And if we have to """"dumb down"""" a word here, the same precedent would theoretically have to be set for the entire English Wikipedia, thereby degrading the quality of articles. As someone pointed out, if readers cannot grasp the lingusitics of the standard English wikipedia, there's Simple English to cater to that need. So, that's my offer for a solution. Dictionaries are as important of a resource as an encyclopedia and complement one another: Get the information you want and if you don't know what a word means, just look it up.

Given this then it is impossible for me to get treated fairly as you are apparently biased towards them. I find it astounding that you have gone to great lengths to supress my views by blocking me from editing, blocking me from contacting the head as well as yourself and for added measure you have blocked me from emailing. All because I complained about my treatment, lets face it the excuse about me edit warring is just a smokescreen, you just don't like it when I diagree with a point of view. Are you following the orders of Blixx and co? Yet you make no mention of their personal attacks and abuse on me - they have called me 'a nasty piece of work', 'an islamist', 'Haddad's puppet' etc. Have you even warned them? I think not. So its ok for them to make personal attacks on me but when I criticise Blixx and co I get punished. One rule for one and one rule for another eh?
 
Thank you for explaining what the word contraversial means to me. Maybe you can explain the meaning of another word for me - HYPOCRITE.

 Why do procaryotic endospores get their own entry rather than being classified as a type of spore?  What is it about the definition of """"spore"""" that the bacterial kind doesn't meet?  Their sporulation and germination processes and triggering conditions are analogous to those of diploid eukaryotes, and the asymmetric fission leading to formation of an endospore is similarly analogous to that of the asymmetric division producing eucaryotic spores.

The 2008 ratification of The Great Lakes Commission finally commits American and Canadian governments to the geographical definition of the North American Great Lakes as a distinctive political entity.  In fact and operation, the complex cooperative management of The Great Lakes for purposes of trade, border discipline, parks, transportation, hydro-power, water management and environmental protection has been a reality since 1815.   Ethnically and economically, the borders have always been porous.   Politically, the region has more bi-national commonalities than generally supposed.    Much of Ontarian political culture derived from both Anglo-American heritage and the simultaneous influence and threat of American examples.   More importantly, both the American and Canadian sides played analogous roles in the world-economy.   Both sides of the border transformed from peripheries that supplied natural resources; to semi-peripheries that performed middle-man brokerage functions; to core regions, represented by such world cities as Chicago and Toronto, that provided hubs of capital, administration, and management.   History, politics, culture, and ethnic composition, as well as the more obvious economy, technology, and geology, define Ontario and American Great Lakes states as one region.  04:11, 27 January 2009",0,0,0,0,0,0

I don't think the problem is with including Latin as an example, but rather that after 'veni, vidi, vici' it gives a """"literal"""" translation as 'came, saw, conquered' and then an """"idiomatic"""" translation that reads 'I came, etc.' The problem is that 'came, saw, conquered' would not be considered a """"literal"""" translation by any Latin scholar or teacher. I am a Latin teacher and I would expect the pronoun expressed in an English rendering since it's clearly expressed in the Latin. The """"literal"""" translation implies that Latin doesn't mark person and number on verbs, which is of course false. Now that I look at the other examples it looks like this problem pervades the article. Someone is trying to """"recreate"""" the effect of such languages (I call them pro-drop) in English. The problem is that you can't create the effect in English, which is one of the points of the article, i.e. English is not a null-subject language!

On the contrary: the version that you were attempting to revert to - is unstable, because the chapter you'd removed, was added three years ago (on 5 May 2008), and lasted until 14 March 2011, i.e. until the day before yestreday, whereas the version you were attempting to revert to - lasted for less than 40 hours only - that were uncontinuous and broken, so which version is more stable?
Returning the chapter you'd removed - is not against the consensus at all. The chapter is supported by User:(MOB)DeadMeat, and is also supported by User:Chrishatch1973, and is also supported by User:Eliko; whereas the removal of the chapter is supported by User:Basket of Puppies only. Really, it was also supported (in the past) by User:DragonflySixtyseven, however their reason for the removal - was refuted on their talk page (and on the article talk page as well), and they didn't respond to the refutation. According to the law: Silence gives consent, the very fact that User:DragonflySixtyseven didn't respond to the refutation - shows that User:DragonflySixtyseven does not reject the explanation given on their talk page (and on the article talk page as well) for returning the chapter. To sum up, three editors (User:(MOB)DeadMeat, User:Chrishatch1973 and User:Eliko) support the chapter, and one single user (User:Basket of Puppies) rejects it, so which option is more consensual? Returning the chapter, or removing it?
The chapter you removed is relevant, as I'd explained on the article talk page - before you removed the chapter. If you think the chapter is irrelevant - despite my explanation (on the article talk page) why it's relevant, then please discuss that on the article talk page.

Note that when you responded to me on my talk page - each one of us had made one revert only - during 2011, so: considering that the single revert I've made during 2011 - was sufficient for you to warn me of your reporting me for WP:3RR and edit-warring - if I """"continue to revert"""", also your single revert you've made during 2011 - should be sufficient for me to warn you of my reporting you for WP:3RR and edit-warring - if you """"continue to revert"""".
If you continue to both - remove a consensual chapter - and replace it by an unstable version which is against the consensus, then I will report you for violating Wikipedia policy, that requires - to discuss everything on the article talk page - before removing a consensual chapter and before replacing it by an unstable version which is against the consensus.
Anyways: due to your claim about irrelevance, I will add to the (stable consensual) chapter - some clarifications, to make sure that every reader (including User:Basket of Puppies) understands its relevance.

 i forgot 

I forgot to tell you many things in my other, long, discussion subject, here is one of them (because you say directly and indirectly that you have no interest in the historical truth, but in favouring the roman empire because you are a fan of it, as you explain here on your page):

Besides, never ever no way no how in the whole history of the roman empire, the romans (esspecially in the catastrofal financial situation in Rome, when the empire was on the virge of colaps because of it's lack of money!) never waged costly and long battles against other nations in order to force those nations to accept huge gold tribute from Rome, so those nations can """"built and strenghten their fortresses for future attacks"""", like you, history falsifiers, argumented the roman tribute payed to the Dacians in 88 AD as well as in 102 AD, when the common sense men asked you """"how come those wars were won by romans if at the end of them the romand had to pay anual tribute to the dacians?"""".

And you started to buulshit that that money was """"for building and strenghten the fortresses/defences"""", going so far in your bullshit that for the following war (AD 105) you, as roman empire fan and as such automatically history falsifier), as reason for this roman attack/war on Dacia, you mentioned again the invading romans as """"the good guys""""😉, and the dacians as """"the bad, cut trouths, robbers, dacians""""😉, which were """"justfull punished by the romans"""" in this """"punitive"""" war against the dacians IN DACIA, because """"the dacians used the money received from the romans after the last war and used ut for.. building and strenghten the fortresses/defences""""(!), so for exactly what they were suppose to use it, according to your own afirmations!! Duuh! 

So the roman empire did not invade other countries to demand """"protection money"""" (tribute) from them to not invade them again(tipical italian culture/maffia), but they invaded the world TO PAY anual tribute to those countries??

I do not know what medication do you use, but you obviously forgot to take it for a long time.

Well, you are a roman or a roman fan, so it's understanable that you have no clue what so ever what are you talking about. You are focussing on 1 thing only: Praising the cut throuts romans and presenting them as """"the best and most civilised people in the World"""", which invaded, masacred, robbed and enslaved countless nations and civilisations, because... """"they were the good guys, period""""😉.

Also enjoying throwing women and children (plus everybody actually) alive to wilde beasts to eat them alive in the arena (Damnatio Ad Bestias), was another obvious sign of the """"roman civilisation""""😉 which you admire so much, and which thus also says much about you, who and what you are.

It is used to differentiate between these non-traditional styles and long-established and integritous forms of Heavy Metal, such as thrash metal, power metal, death metal, black metal, doom metal, and the NWOBHM among others.""""

The trouble with Mahler analysis is that there isn't a consensus about his compositional thinking.   So, like it or not, comments are going to be subjective, and may well look like """"original research"""".    But it ought to be possible to explain why he thought of this work as a symphony (he deliberately withheld a number from it, because he had a superstition about Ninth Symphonies being terminal: the work we know as his Ninth was in fact his Tenth, and, like Das Lied von der Erde, posthumously premiered).   This article doesn't address that.   It has been suggested that the six movements can actually be seen as covering the traditional four - movements 3 -5 jointly fulfilling the scherzo function and helping to balance the finale.  (One also quotes the Eighth Symphony's second movement).  It might be possible to find in the finale a texture resembling a hybrid of scena and aria (two of each, separated by a funeral march, based on elements of the Trinklied which begins the work, in the role of a development section) and sonata.  The last section of the finale with its repeated """"Ewig"""", could also be seen  both as  a cabaletta and the coda to the whole symphonic conception.   So the intellectual and formal weight distribution of the classical symphony is completely reversed.  But we still have something which can be called a symphony, even though nothing more different from its immediate predecessor, the Eighth, could be imagined.

9f53b58f58bd7542,"General review of article ==

The Wikipedia article on François Mitterrand, who served as president of France from 1981 to 1995, does not take a neutral stance on the man and his career. The language, organization and fact choices of the article make clear the author’s negative opinion of Mitterrand. Even though the sources of information for the article are weak, the author attempts to convey the disreputable nature of his career by citing various scandals and controversies. Because the author is biased, it is difficult to obtain an accurate picture of Mitterrand from reading this article.

By the end of the third paragraph, with the comment about Mitterrand denying having received the Francisque, the author is already trying to establish Mitterrand’s sketchy past. He or she is trying to persuade the reader that Mitterrand was a less than honorable man who will be remembered more for scandals than for what he accomplished during his presidency. The author mentions Charles de Gaulle’s supposed dislike of Mitterrand, his covering up of illegal acts during the repression of the independence movement, and a possible attempt to stage his own assassination. Other scandals include false health reports, adultery, and an anti-terror cell he set up that may have “obtained wiretaps on journalists, politicians and other personalities who may have been an impediment for Mitterrand’s personal affairs.” Scandals are mentioned throughout the article and the author ends with a section devoted to them, so the reader is left with little recollection of Mitterrand’s accomplishments but a strong memory of the controversy that surrounded the president’s career. 

Though the author uses phrases like “he was said to,” one senses that the author is assuming that the alleged stories are fact, and that he has drawn conclusions about Mitterrand based on those stories. Also, the author mentions Mitterrand in relation to other leaders and sometimes it appears that Mitterrand does not measure up. The author seems to favor Charles de Gaulle, noting that Mitterrand was “one of the few to object to the nomination of Charles de Gaulle as head of the government and de Gaulle’s plan for a French Fifth Republic.” The author also uses a phrase usually applied to de Gaulle’s decline to Mitterrand’s decline (“crossing of the desert”). When discussing Mitterrand’s annual laying of a wreath on Philippe Pétain’s grave, the author makes sure to remark that “the annual tributes…marked a departure from those of his predecessors.”

The article is convincing in its portrayal of Mitterrand as a controversial figure whose career was characterized by some major accomplishments but also a great deal of scandal. The article also convinces the reader that much about Mitterrand is not known for sure; there is a fair amount of speculation surrounding all of it. It appears that the author tries to downplay Mitterrand’s accomplishments and convince the reader that his legacy is not a good one. This is not convincing however, because Mitterrand served longer as president than any other man; he must have been more popular than the author makes him out to be.

The sources for this article appear inadequate. Unlike some Wikipedia articles, this article does not have a bibliography or list of references so it is unclear where the author is getting his information. He says that one piece of information comes from author Jean Montaldo but does not list the book. There are three numbered links within the article: two links to articles from the French newspaper Le Monde, and one link to an article on netscape.qc.ca. While these are acceptable sources, they cannot compare to primary sources or articles from historical journals. The lack of adequate sources makes some of the author’s claims questionable.

The quality of writing of the article is not outstanding. There is a typo in the second paragraph: “an mid-level functionary.” At times it is a bit choppy and the paragraphs do not always flow into each other perfectly. The author also devotes an entire section to the famous last meal, and only briefly mentions Mitterrand’s personal life at the end of the presidency section. The article ends with a paragraph that states Mitterrand personally authorized what New Zealand called their first terror attack, which is an interesting choice for a conclusion that leaves the reader associating Mitterrand with terror and bombing. The inclusion of the discovery of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus is puzzling and seems unnecessary, as do the two paragraphs about Bérégovoy and Pelat. It appears that some pieces of information were included simply to paint a more negative portrait of Mitterrand. 

I would have liked to know more about Mitterrand’s “great projects,” because the projects that are listed seem to be very significant structures in France. Some additional information about his personal life woul",0,0,0,0,0,0

Just a few thoughts/reccs, do with as you will

Nice significant adds of content.  Kind of leading to following

A. On the Myth section, you've kind of got stuff at both the front and at the beginning that contrasts versus Ovid. 

1. I would move that stuff you have on top of Ovid that is comparisons and then put it down integrated into the later section. cut the summary of the summaries (nuke that).  So it would go 2 equals Myth, no writing, 3 equals Ovid, then 3 equals other myths

2.  Within  Ovid, maybe add some comment about Metamorphoses being wildly popular (RS avail in wiki article for that) at the time and that Ovid;s version is has become the familiar version of t

he myth to present day people.  Then all the story telling.

3.  I like how you've got more meat in Other versions.  But take it even a step further.  Give me some dates.  Let me know if any of the versions were known to have influenced each other or Ovid (don't explain a negative, but if there is anyhing mentione it.  And discuss all the differences in story (you have that).

B.  Not perfect, but would stick the Guardian comment in Interprectation, at beginning or end.  It's commentary on the myth, not literature.

C.  I like the in-article discussion of myrrh.  You will get some who kvetch, but the two are so linked and the term so strange to the modern ear.  I might move all the myrrh stuff except the Latin name (so the Biblical notes and acnient usage) and stick it at the end of etymology and origin.  Follows well after the myrrh-Myrrha word linkage.  And explains the substance a little earlier in article (so doing more good).  Only bad thing is you lose the connection to the image of myrrh.  could just switch back to lady bug though.  donno if there is a way to fit two images in that tiny Origins section.  you do have pics of the tree anyhow in the form of her transformation.

D.  There are some things I remember missing now.  If that is intentional, editorially fine.

9f6b3c99d53304d1,"Oh yes, there are quite a few ways to handle that sort of thing. At its simplest, click on the history tab to see a list of all the edits made to an article in reverse chronological order. Then click on the date&time; of the last good edit to see the page as it used to be (in this case, that would be click on the 22:15, 9 September 2005 edit by User:Tsemii but avoid clicking on the username itself). Now click 'edit this page' and in addition to the normal edit box you should also see a warning at the top that you are editing an out of date version of the page. That's OK, in this case it is what you want. Don't make any changes to the text, just enter an edit summary like 'reverting to last good version by xxxx' or 'rv test', press the 'save page' and you are done.
Another way, is to bring up the page history, then click on the word 'last' to the left of the bad edit. This should bring up a page like this highlighting differences made by the bad edit. You can get a similar page by clicking the 'diff' link from your watchlist. Then clicking on 'Revision as of 22:15, 9 September 2005' at the top of the left panel, will take you to the earlier good version, and you can make a null edit and save as before. The advantage of using this page difference approach is that there are also links to go forward and back to newer and older edits. So if a vandal has made a series of bad edits you can keep stepping back until you reach a good version of the article before editing and saving to revert to that version.
If a user is looking like being a problem, you can drop them a note on their talk page, asking them to stop. There are a number of templates for boilerplate warning messages which escalate from  to . Typically if a user has recently had one of the earlier test warning, you add the next one in the sequence and sign it. However, if you are reaching test4, its a good idea to get an admin involved because the next step is to block them.
If you have the time, you can also check the user's other contributions to see whether they have been messing up any other pages, and if they have, revert those pages too. However, if they look like being a particularly busy vandal, its usually best to get help from an admin at Wikipedia:Vandalism in progress, because admins have some extra 'rollback' buttons to make it much easier to undo a large number of changes.
I've reverted the particular edit at Agricultural machinery, but this one just looks like a harmless test, so no further action was needed. Many anon users still find it hard to believe that their changes really are for real and immediately visible to everyone. So we see a lot of random edits like this.

Karate IS a Japanese martial art, with roots in older Chinese martial arts. Japanese (actually Okinawan) masters of the 19th and early 20th century have changed the art into a new, modern fighting art, just as languages change, like Bihal writes: French is a French language.

 EditFilter Idea 

I originally posted this to Triplestop, but he suggested I ask you.

I've been looking at the edit filter documentation and I would like to contribute a possible candidate to look for new editors changing birthdates, a fairly common and sneaky problem. I'm not looking for full edit-filter rights, but I would like to help develop the appropriate filter. If you don't have the time to deal with this right now let me know, and I'll engage someone else.

I am new to the syntax, but here's my general format right now:

(user_editcount < 50) & (article_namespace == 0) & (lcase(added_lines) rlike """"dateofbirth *=+|birth ?da(te|y)|\(born |\(b\. """") & (lcase(added_lines) rlike """""""") & (lcase(removed_lines) rlike """""""")

Where I have  is the birthday searching regex I've been working on. Below is what I've developed so far. I haven't tested it extensively, but I've thrown it against a few BLPs and it works fairly well. It finds the usual ways that birthdays are presented, either in template, or in lead, for example (b. January 1, 2010).

Here's the regex
(date of birth *=+|b\.[^&-]+(&.dash;|-+)|\( *born |birth ?da(te|y) *=+|\() *(([0-3]?[0-9],?)? *(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)\.?[^0-9\.]*([0123]?[0-9],? *)[12][0-9]{3})|(\{\{birth[^\}]+\}\}).*$

I don't know how to check for what specifically was edited, as in if a numerical value was changed. Is Edit Filter able to do this sort of thing? I welcome any other ideas you have. I assume this will require more work. But please let me know how to push this along.

I hold the science of physics to be the following: the endeavour to account for the whole corpus of observations in a coherent mathematical framework. It all begins with observations, and observations should always be the final word. 

Whenever a principle can be stated in a form that is not committed to any specific theory, it should be stated in that uncommitted form. The Equivalence principle is prime example of that. 

The Harvard tower experiment indicates that there is no clash between quantumphysics and GR as far as measureable aspects of physics are concerned. At present the formal frameworks of the two theories cannot be reconciled, but the measurements agree. 

The principle of relativity of special relativity can be formulated in a theory-committed form, but Einsteins choice of principle is best: in all frames of reference that are not measurably accelerated, measurement of the velocity of electromagnetic radiation will yield the same value.  | Talk 06:30, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)",0,0,0,0,0,0

The same sort of hypocrisy was current in matters of religion.

In this, Polish practices resembled that of Great Britain or Holland, and until bishops were goaded into retaliation in the 1770s, had been far more tolerant that that of Russia, whose visiting armies had invariably inflicted forcible conversion on the Republic's Uniates.

One of the things that bugs me about the writers who claim that the Midwest accent is the standard American accent is their fishbowl view. They view their own accent as the correct one. What do you think somebody from Georgia or Texas would think of that? Is this another """"to the victor goes the spoils"""" from the Civil War? The north gets to have the """"correct"""" accent? The population of southern speakers is barely a minority, I'd hate to be from Louisiana and hear some egomaniac from Iowa talk about his accent being the right one. It's like the woman who says the toilet seat should be down, even though 50% of the population uses it the other way, she thinks her way is the right way. Newscasters generally speak with a northern accent, I can attest to that, but they come from all over, and how many of them are deliberately trained to speak like a Midwesterner? I can't imagine such a thing. Would a newscaster from Albany NY or Seattle, or LA, or Connecticut, where people all have basically the standarn northern accent, need to change to some sort of cornfield Nebraska twang? Hell no. The Midwestern accent is not really typical anyway, I lived in Michigan for a year and people have an unusual accent there, not the typical newscaster accent. They say everything is """"the bomb,"""" but they pronounce bomb as if it were spelled """"bahm."""" Their accent may be the bahm, but is NOT the standard way to pronounce things in journalism. I would say that of all the places in the USA that have the most neutral speach, that journalists would try to emulate, this region where I live beats out the Midwest for neutrality. Eastern upstate NY, from Poughkeepsie to Syracuse. Also Connecticut, they hae no trace of the New England weirdness that you see in Vermont or Maine, or most of Mass. And northwestern Mass has the Vermont accent. Very little of Mass is free of the weird New England thing. Worchester, forget it...very thick there. Probably the only accent-free part of Mass. is around Springfield, or southwestern Mass in general. That's like Connecticut, which is neutral. The Vermont accent is only found among the older people. Young kids in Vermont are not carrying this on at all. The old timers with their """"Pepperidge Faam Remembas"""" accent with all the """"ayaah,"""" well that was a Swedish accent and the grandchildren of the Swedes don't talk that way anymore. Not at all. As for the NYC accent, that only goes as far north as Peekskill unless you count all the transplanted NYC folks, especially after September 11, who moved upstate by the millions lately. As far north as Poughkeepsie, there are a good number of NYC folks that moved up, but the native Poughkeepsie people have the basic American accent, and the children of the NYC folks lose their accent in one generation. North or west of Albany, there are very few NYC transplants and no accent at all, except for the rednecks. And what can you do about the rednecks?  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Re: Tracker (business software) 

Hello, thanks for your comments on my talk page.  You mention that the article was """"already reviewed by admins and approved for inclusion in Wikipedia"""".  I tried to make clear the purpose of my edit in the edit summary, but I guess I didn't do a good enough job.  I read through the AFD, the DRV, and the past deletions to get an idea of what was going on.  AFD/DRV were able to determine the notability of the article, but you hit it right on in your comment to me that in it's past state the article wasn't much more than a product sheet, which to me is synonymous with advertising.  Wikipedia articles aren't about features lists or product offerings, they are about bringing together neutral, third-party-verified information about topics.  As I'm sure you've seen I rearranged the page a little more since.  I have no problem with the screenshots or product names & descriptions, so I tried several things which display that information in a little bit more standard Wikipedia.  (Also, this is minor, but Wikipedia admins are no different in terms of article approval than any other editor. I am also an admin, but that just gives me the ability to work on more technical aspects of the project).

You are welcome to expand on the article as it is now, but it would be preferable to do it by gathering information from the many third-party sources listed.  The article is very well sourced, but not very much of that information is brought into the article.

As for the List of project management software, with such a relatively short list, it is inappropiate to have several links to the same family of products.  I don't know a way would satisfy your concern, other than to suggest to put the link in the best place you see fit. In the future, it might be worthwhile listing separately the desktop and the web-based products, but not while there is only enough information for one article.  Again, please remember the primary focus of Wikipedia (see What Wikipedia is not), which is to bring neutral information, not advertising or promoting.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Is WP a general encyclopedia that includes philatelic material, or a union of general and specialized encyclopedias?

It's been removed and archived in the page history for now, but if you'd like to include a citation and re-add it, please do so! If you need guidance on referencing, please see the referencing for beginners tutorial, or if you think I made a mistake, you can leave me a message on my talk page. Thank you. Dwpaul Talk 

Information icon Please do not add commentary or your own personal analysis to Wikipedia articles, as you did to Tom Cotton. Doing so violates Wikipedia's neutral point of view policy and breaches the formal tone expected in an encyclopedia. Thank you. Dwpaul Talk 

Please learn to properly add and format citations. I have edited your entry at Tom Cotton to do so and to remove the quote you inserted from the Logan Act, the inclusion of which here is still editorialization. Instead, I linked to the Logan Act, where readers can judge its relevance for themselves. Also, I'm not sure where or how you obtained my full name, but it is unnecessary (and unwelcome) that you included it in your edit summaries. Please read WP:OUTING.

Hi,

Are you there Sue Anne? This needs your urgent attention.

Apropos my earlier message to you, I removed the pathetic PA from Royboycrashfan 's talk page and warned Crossmr against the PA along with a fair note. Please do read that note.

But he removed my first warning and also reverted back the pathetic PA comment on roy's user page ALONG WITH pathetic PA's AGAIN, in both edit summaries.

I gave him a final warning as he repeatedly violated NPA and would not cease and desist.

Yet he continued with his same unacceptable behaviour.

The edit histories of the talk pages of User_talk:Royboycrashfan and User_talk:Crossmr will make this very clear. He keeps deleting and reverting along with PA's in the edit summary inspite of being EXPLICITLY warned.

This is totally unacceptable. Please do take immediate action.

You know me, atleast a little. There is no way anyone can get away with calling me a vandal. You know I am not here to vandalize, but I have contributed meaningfully to a few articles whatever little time I have been on here.

Of course, there were a few misinformed civil issues along the way (which served to inform me about the policy on civility, NPA etc.), but after the block and blowing off a little steam, my behaviour has been perfectly good as can be expected of any genuine user.

even Vesther for that matter with whom I had a little argument would not call me a vandal.

Also there is another admin Nearly Headless Nick who has appreciated my edits to a certain page. 
Also have made a few edits to other articles the few times i was on.

But surely just because anyone is a very occasional user, that CANNOT be used as an excuse for letting anyone get away with PAs.

Also, NPA specifically states that earlier misinformed mistakes and behaviour CANNOT be used as an EXCUSE for a PA. 
If people kept harping on about old issues, it would become acceptable to attack anyone as everyone makes mistakes in the past.

Crossmr  just CANNOT be allowed to get away with his unacceptable MALICIOUS behaviour.

Please BLOCK him symbolically for whatever time you feel is right, to mainly PREVENT him and later forbid him from:

1. Reverting the pathetic PA on Roy's page along with the pathetic PA edit summaries.

2. Removing my very first warning message with a very civil note. I dont care about the second warning, but the first warning serves as a placeholder for record's sake.

Even after EXPLICIT and SPECIFIC warnings not to continue, he continued with his unacceptable behaviour and BLATANTLY violated NPA that too in edit summaries.
Even after being explicitly advised to assume good faith (AGF), he has failed to do so.

Cmon, for whatever you think of me (ur earlier silence), you KNOW I am not a vandal.

Please take appropriate steps as a fair and upright ADMIN.

I am logging off now, other stuff to do. Will log on tomorrow.

I do hope and expect you to symbolically block Crossmr, which will prevent him from continuing to behave unacceptably as he has blatantly violated NPA even after being repeatedly warned about it.

:For the religious process,  see Get (divorce document) 

A 'get or ghet is a Jewish bill of divorce which is supervised by a Beth Din which is a rabbinical court in the city or jurisdiction where one lives. This page deals with the Conflict of Laws or civil law implications vs Judaic Law (religious law) when a women does not get her ghet and is kept in """"agunah"""" which means chained.http://www.icar.org.il For a discussion of the purely religious implications, see religious divorce.

Discussion
Jewish communities have maintained a strong desire for religious, cultural and economic autonomy. Jewish Law is administered and enforced Judaic Lawin Israel and in the Diaspora through Bet Dins (Houses of Judges) Judaic Law holds that the man must initiate the request for the Jewish Divorce (""""get"""")and the woman must agree to receive the (""""get"""").

The relationship between state and religion

Jewish law or religious law is not justiciable in societies with the civil law doctrine of separation of Church and State which can sometimes cause conflict for women who remain in """"agunah"""". One of the most common divorce difficulties is that a spouse can be held in a limping marriage when the other spouse refuses co-operation in the religious form of divorce (see Agunah). A civil divorce can be obtained through local courts which entitles the parties to remarry civilly, but the capacity to remarry is also religious question. Where one party has the power to grant or withhold a religious divorce, this power can be used as a bargaining tool to pressure the other party to agree more or less favourable terms for residence and contact with children, and for maintenance and property settlements. Such provisions produce a conflict between the human rights of the woman to be free to marry and the freedom of people to practise their religion (see Article 18 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights which is repeated almost word for word in Article  9(1) European Convention on Human Rights, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief).  The difficulty is that most countries operate under constitutions based on a separation between church and state which forbid governments from interfering in the practice of religion within their territory unless the behaviour of one or more parties is in breach of the local civil or criminal law. Thus, for example, in Rhodesia, the case of Berkowitz v Berkowitz (1956) (3) SA 522 (SR), held that it was inappropriate to use contempt proceedings to force a husband to grant a get because anything concerned exclusively with religious formalities was outside the jurisdiction of the secular courts.

Nevertheless, the majority of Western states do, to some extent, make the secular court's response to matrimonial proceedings conditional on the relevant party taking the steps necessary to complete a religious divorce on fair terms, so that either the court will impose excessively generous orders for maintenance and property settlement, or deny access to a civil decree or to ancillary relief until the religious formalities have been completed. 

Canada

In Canada, following consultation with all major religious groups, the Divorce Act was amended in 1985 to add Section 21.1 to give the courts have the power to dismiss any application, and strike out any pleadings and affidavits filed by a spouse who has failed to remove religious barriers to the remarriage of the other spouse. The legislature intended to:
place spouses on a more equal footing in civil divorce actions;
encourage women in particular to exercise fully their rights under the law; and
maintain the integrity of the Divorce Act 1985 by helping to ensure that refusing to accept or to give a religious divorce was not used as a bargaining tool to gain unfair concessions on child custody and access, or monetary support. 
This reflects a general strong response at a federal level to any elements of duress or undue influence within the civil law system.

With due respect this dog's breakfast of an article deserves a POV rampage and a much more exhaustive one than the minor changes made on December 11. Please look over some of the undocumented, irrelevant, and in some cases just plain weird interpretations of Revelation that were removed or edited and suggest which edits should be undone. The article as a whole is unnecessarily repetitive and only a small fraction of it represents the views of modern scholarship (see my comments above under Talk section 11: Everyone's view).

On Thomas Jefferson: Myth America I sympathise with your concern to '[provide] a useful contrast to the other interpretations in the article' which generally reflect conservative christian in-fighting about the meaning of the book but tell us very little about Revelation itself. I'm not convinced, however, that to dismiss the work as the incoherent ravings of an early christian """"heretic"""" (Cerinthus) is the best way to do this. A number of scholars have demonstrated that the book follows a clearly marked concentric structure which evidences balanced literary construction, while it has long been acknowledged that Revelation parodies and inverts the imagery of first century roman imperialism and the emperor cult in particular to make it's point (see eg Steven J Friesen's recent work in this area: Imperial Cults and the Apocalypse of John). This hardly supports Jefferson's view that the work is a meaningless rant but nor does it support the highly subjective perspectives of historicism and futurism which have obviously irritated you. A balanced, well documented historical-critical introduction to the work should, in my opinion, make up the bulk of this article with other conservative christian approaches acknowledged separately in brief, concise fashion. I am quite happy for the Jefferson reference to remain for its whimsical value and tentatively suggest that it could be accompanied by some of the numerous historical warnings by prominent christian leaders and commentators about the danger of misusing the book.

I also note that the reference to Mithraic parallels has been re-inserted in the Authorship section. What this has to do with the question of authorship I have no idea. The parallel itself is completely unconvincing and the book from which it is taken is a typical example of an author falling in love with his subject and unnecessarily exaggerating its importance. While I don't deny that the work, by Payam Nabarz, represents a good layman's guide to Mithraism the suggested parallel between this quote and Revelation 1:4-20 on page 51 (see Google books for the text) hardly warrants the preface that the two are 'almost identical' or the overly enthusiastic observation that 'the [similarity of] spirit is abundant... to the extent that the names of Jesus and Mithras could be interchangeable'. These are not the remarks of a careful exegete. It is quite likely that there are echoes of Mithraism, the religion of the roman army, in Revelation, which freely reuses both Jewish and greco-roman mythology in polemical fashion, but this is not one of them. Would anyone object to a re-removal of this paragraph?
  

""""this... article deserves a POV rampage""""— All I can say to that is read this WP:NPOV.
Why not be inclusionist instead of deleting chunks of information you don't personally agree with?

   Your supporting proving my point about your bias.

Others seeing that as an insult is their right.  I could put """"HAILSATAN666"""" as my username and i'm sure you'd probably say that's offensive too whereas I'd say that's kind of a religious motto and greeting.  What part of that (SATANLOVESGAYMEN) is """"offensive""""?  If you don't like that or interpret it a different way, you're welcome to do so.  That is kind of one of the important aspects of Satanism.  The word """"Satan"""" can go anywhere that """"GOD"""" can and shouldn't have a different reaction and if it does... not my problem.  Your note and whole argument, and actions against me are outright fallacious and simply trying to use everything i say in a manipulative and out of context manner.

 You should wait for others to write an article about subjects in which you are personally involved. This applies to articles about you, your achievements, your band, your business, your publications, your website, your relatives, and any other possible conflict of interest. 

Creating an article about yourself is strongly discouraged. If you create such an article, it might be listed on articles for deletion. Deletion is not certain, but many feel strongly that you should not start articles about yourself. This is because independent creation encourages independent validation of both significance and verifiability. All edits to articles must conform to Wikipedia:No original research, Wikipedia:Neutral point of view, and Wikipedia:Verifiability. 

If you are not """"notable"""" under Wikipedia guidelines, creating an article about yourself may violate the policy that Wikipedia is not a personal webspace provider and would thus qualify for speedy deletion.

 Followup re TPm case voting, etc 

Courcelles, as your response to my previous query failed to answer the question as to why you would vote on the my topic ban the same day that the FoF was posted by AGK versus your statement to Malke that the """"last thing you needed to do"""" was to vote on her topic ban, etc., I'm wondering what your history of interaction on Wikipedia with Malke has been in the past.

Since it was raised on the Evidence pageby meyou cannot not have been aware of the fact that she was sanctioned for similar behavior in 2010. You also must have been aware of the fact that she had accused me several times of being a sockpuppet of Dylan somebody-or-other, and made other strange assertions, as I detailed on the Evidence page. You seem to have ignored all of the above in your vote regarding sanctions against Malke, and voted for sanctions against me before any discussion of the FoF had even had a chance to take place.

So, I am investigating you, independently, as it were. You may find that amusing, but I have just explained the rationale, and I hope you take me seriously. 

If you'd care to explain what you found most offensive in my editing conduct on that article, it might save me the time an effort of examining your interaction history with Malke to see whether or not maybe you should have recused yourself from the case altogether, or at least from voting on Malke, as NYB did (recuse himself). 連絡 見学/迷惑 """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Statement 

I was angry at what I consider to be a massive campaign against Ed Poor's RFA. I rarely, if ever, agree with Ed on anything, but I felt the opposes were over the top. My comment about riff-raff is not uncivil. Riff-raff is a child's word, if I wanted to be insulting or uncivil I would have used much harsher words than that, I assure you. Further, I felt that many of the attacks on Ed by the opposers were far worse than that, even the before-refactored comment. I was responding to my believe that Ed Poor needs to be allowed to bring his dissent to the Intelligent Design and Global Warming articles, despite the fact I totally disagree with his viewpoint. Keeping controversial articles free of being walled gardens of woo is a goal that Wikipedia should seek. We cannot allow even the most righteous people WP:OWN whole swaths of subject matter. Not to be pointed, but the greater scientific community was patently wrong on eugenics, the popular bastardization of Darwin's natural selection, at the turn of the 20th century. I've been reading an excellent book, War Against the Weak by Edwin Black, which catalogs just how it was a group of determined American and British scientists popularized this hideous science and even directly inspired the tactics of Hitler. It is a chilling account of what happens when determined scientists insist their viewpoint is the only viewpoint that matters and how uncritical groupthink led to horrendous travesties being perpatrated against our poor and sick at that period of time. My point is that groupthink is bad. Refusing to debate opposing views is bad. Ed brings the necessary questioning which ultimately results in better articles because lazy and poorly sourced material is kept out, while some space is given for the opposing viewpoint. I feel that my fellow colleagues treatment of Ed, based mostly on his behavior on another project - which by the way is admittedly slanted (the """"conserv"""" in CP should have been the hint) - was aweful. My comments were not directed at anyone in particular and were only meant as an attempt to console Ed on his good faith attempt to serve the community again. Please do not wheel war over this block. I will just go do some move to commons until it is resolved satisfactorily. Cheers!   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Hall and Oates out of touch; the edit dub had to be one of the most
memorable tracks for me in the history of editing. The Latin
Rascals became superstars with rockstar status. Listening to their
edits; you never knew what was coming next; they were frenzied but
on time. They were the first editors I remember playing with speed
(slowing down voices/phrases) They seemed to be on everything from
radio(ktu,kiss fm and hot 103.5 and hot 97.1) club music to hip hop
(king kut; Run Dmc King of Rock) and pop. They produced many hits in
the club/freestyle genre; appeared on movie soundtracks
(disorderlies) and appeared on television (the music show second
generation with andy panda and tony moran) produced a hip hop
platinum album (the fat boys) became succesful artists (bach to the
future; arabian nights) and world reknowned remixers. Out of the
pack (omar santana; carlos berrios, chep nunez, etc...) these guys
did it all. Albert Cabrera appeared on Ktu solo and what he
accomplished with a pause button was nothing short of amazing. I'm
still in shock at some of the things I heard done; this coupled with
the ability to do megamix medleys seperated him from the bunch; when
he paired with tony moran things got crazier. The remixes they did
with Little Louie Vega on vinyl (information society's running)and
the exclusive mixes (called hotmixes specially made for bill lee the
on air personality who requested they do special versions)were
incredible; two of them appeared on cutting remixes; dont' break my
heart and let me be the one. The radio only version of Jody watley's 
I'm lookin for a new love was insane!!!!!!!! So was the
cover girls show me and Noel's silent morning; these were radio only
remixes that never appeared on vinyl. I only heard Little Louie Vega
play them when he rocked hearthrob nightclub in nyc. If anyone has
access to them; I wish they'd post them up. These were definitley
staples in the art of multi editing and remixing. Eternal props
and much respect to The ultimate duo The Latin Rascals!!!!!!

I would recommend trying to limit your list to some
(likely) forgotten names in strictly the tape cutting trade,
or very prominently focussing on cutting up masters,
because the ones we know, like Cabrera, Berrios etc.
well, everyone can mention those...

Also, not all DJ's do impressive cutting.
If we're gonna mention each and every person
who has cut tape once, where do you draw the line?

Remarkable is that this 12 inch does not even credit them
anywhere, even though everybody knew, if only from their

Yes, but it might have been 1982 when Jellybean and Baker
tried out their first versions of 'Confusion' in the Funhouse club.
It usually took quite some time back then, for the world to hear
those tracks, or have them available as a release on vinyl.

Also interesting;
http://www.record-producers.com/roster/arthurbaker/biography.html

And I found:

[Jonathan Scott] """"In early 1984 I spoke to a member of New Orders sound crew
who mentioned a Confusion mix he 'had heard' that was basically an unreleased
Arthur Baker/Jellybean project mixing the basic elements of 'Confusion'
with parts of Freeze's 'IOU'. [...] I have been told that it surfaced
on a dub-plate (acetate) and was produced in a New York cutting house.""""

Reportedly, a mix of Confusion/IOU used to be played a lot at the Hacienda around 1984/85.

I believe the following description on the page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_sensor_size is false: """"However, the larger area does not imply a better low-light sensitivity or higher signal-to-noise ratio. While the light collecting area is larger, this is canceled out by the fact that the same total light from the scene is spread out over a larger area, that is, the light flux per square mm is lower, for a fixed aperture diameter. Larger sensors can still be advantageous for low-light applications because typically lenses for them exist with larger apertures than are possible for smaller sensors.""""

The following was my attempt to correct this information:

""""A given lens will provide the same density of light on any sensor at a given aperture. For sensors with the same number of megapixels (MP), a large sensor will have proportionately larger pixels. The pixels on a 10 MP Full-Frame sensor will be more than twice as large as the pixels on an APS-C (2.3 times for Nikon, and 2.6 times for Canon). The larger pixel size is one of the reasons that full frame sensors typically have both superior sensitivity and reduced noise in low light in comparison to smaller sensors.  The smaller sensor is equivalent to a cropped section of the larger sensor but with smaller pixels, therefore much of the light from a full frame lens will fall off the edges of the smaller sensor and is """"wasted."""" Theoretically, a 10 MP (Canon) APS-C sensor should perform the same as a 26.3 MP full frame sensor, all other factors being equal.

Although a given lens will produce the same depth of field (DOF) regardless of the sensor, in practice DOF is also affected by the sensor size. This is because at a given focal length the photographer must stand further away from the subject in order to frame the same shot when using a camera with a smaller sensor. Since the DOF increases with the focal distance (distance between the lens and the subject), a photograph taken with an APS-C camera will have a deeper DOF than the identical photograph taken with a full frame camera using the same lens and aperture setting. The photographer can alternatively select a wider angle lens for the APS-C camera and stand at the same focal distance as with the full frame camera to frame the same shot, however the DOF will be affected in the exact same way since DOF also increases with wider angle (shorter focal length) lenses.""""

However it was deleted with no counter argument or explanation of the facts. I believe my description was clear, but I will leave the false information in place as I see no way to make the explanation any clearer than this.

On the other hand, if you go to University and get a degree in statistics or economics, you will get a degree called """"Bachelor of Science"""". That means that you are both a scientist and an academic. 
This is your last free English lesson: academin=/=scientist. 
Please, adopt a less beligerent attitude.
Thanks,   09:39, 4 October""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Safi is from Iran, where images of the Prophet are tolerated. He also reports in his book that he is wary of telling his non-Iranian friends that the image in his home is of Muhammad, because he finds they react badly to it. Cf. the discussion on pages 184–186 in the book by Carl W. Ernst (""""While Muslims in other countries might find this objectionable, it seems to cause no comment in Iran.""""). It is a question of proportion. Safi takes the view, as an Iranian muslim, that images of Muhammad are okay. They're part of the culture he grew up in.

Władysław was married twice. At the very beginning of 1634, or even at the end of 1633 Władysław asked pope Urban VIII for permission (or better to say promise of permission, since no name was included) to marry a Protestant princess. The pope refused, which Władysław treated as insult. At the beginning of 1634 Władysław sent Aleksander Przypkowski with a secret mission to king of England Charles I. Envoy had to discuss king's marriage plans and English help for reconstruction of Polish fleet. King's marriage plans were discussed on Senate meeting on 19 March 1635, but only four bishops were present and only one supported plan.

 there is nothing more sad then an administrator who bans people just because they have written a superior article. 

Let me clear up a few things here. First off, I am not an """"IRA supporter"""". I am a 36 year old proud former US Marine who served my country and I resent being called a """"Terrorist Supporter"""". I have never given money to the IRA, I am Irish Catholic and I support Sinn Fein, but not the IRA. I personally do not believe the IRA are terrorists in the same veign as the UDA/UVF, Hezbollah or Al Qaida. The IRA is much more like the Iraqi Kurds, Northern Alliance, Jewish Irgun, French Resistence, and American Revolutionaries. I am also not a UDA/UVF terrorist apologist as Jdorney seems to be.

I also resent being banned just because some wanna-be administrator is upset that my article contains more accuracies then his does. I have re-edited my article and placed all the proper Sources, page numbers, and Quotes. I have also added to the """"Sources"""" index. I have never ment to purposely delete anyones work, if I did so it was by accident and I apologize. I spent weeks researching this article, and alot of it is based on an article I wrote on the IRA when I was stationed at Camp. Pendleton back in 2000, the rest of it is from newer sources and books.

I certainly don't mind other people adding to the article, but I don't think that my edits should be deleted, just because they don't """"fit"""" with the bias of some editor's and administrators.

I couldn't help but read your website and how you insult visitors who download shows for free by calling them """"bottom feeders"""".  Denny, they are not bottom feeders.

The Objectivity of this Discussion is doubtful (non-existent)

(1) As indicated earlier, the section on Marxist leaders’ views is misleading:

(a) it lays unwarranted and excessive emphasis on Trotsky, creating the misleading impression that other prominent Marxists (Marx, Engels, Lenin) did not advocate and/or practiced terrorism;

(b) it lays unwarranted and excessive emphasis on the theoretical “rejection of individual terrorism”, creating the misleading impression that this is the main (only) Marxist position on terrorism. 

(2) The discussion is not being properly monitored:

(a) no discernible attempt is being made to establish and maintain an acceptable degree of objectivity;

(b) important and relevant scholarly works such as the International Encyclopedia of Terrorism are being ignored or illicitly excluded from the discussion;

(c) though the only logical way to remedy the blatant imbalance in the above section is to include quotes by/on other leaders who are known to have endorsed and practiced terrorism all attempts to do so have been systematically blocked with impunity by the apologists for Marxist terrorism who have done their best to sabotage and wreck both the article and the discussion.

(3) Among the tactics deployed by the apologist wreckers and saboteurs the following may be identified as representative examples:

(a) it is claimed that Marx and Engels did not advocate terrorism despite the fact that scholarly works like the International Encyclopedia of Terrorism show that they did, and Marx himself was known as “The Red Terror Doctor”;

(b) it is claimed that Marx and Engels were not involved in terrorist activities despite the fact that numerous sources from The Neue Rheinische Zeitung to Isaiah Berlin and Francis Wheen state otherwise;

(c) it is claimed that Lenin does not refer to terror in The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade K. Kautsky and other works/statements despite the fact that Robert Service, IET, and other scholarly and reliable sources state that he does;

(d) it is claimed that the Russian word ‘’strakh’’ does not mean “terror” when:

i. the Oxford Russian Dictionary says that it does;

ii. it is evident from the context that this is the case;

iii. any educated Russian speaker can confirm that strakh may mean “terror” depending on the context;

(e) it is claimed that Marxism is “scientific” when in fact:

i. Marx was not a scientist;

ii. Marx’s background was philosophy and law, not science;

iii. Marxism is not recognized as a science by the academic world;

iv. virtually every one of Marx’s predictions turned out to be wrong, as became increasingly apparent during his lifetime and incontrovertibly so after his death (R. Pipes, Communism: A Brief History, 2001, p. 15) from which it follows that Marxism does not qualify as a scientific system by any accepted standards;

v. the evidence indicates that Marxism is closer to a religious sect than to science proper;

(f) apologist literature is being quoted in a fraudulent attempt to whitewash Marxist terrorism, in effect turning the discussion into an advertisement for terrorism;

(g) it is claimed that Marxist terrorism is not rooted in the Marxist theory of class struggle even though there are numerous sources showing that it is (please note that it is immaterial whether terrorism had already been justified in terms of a theory of class prior to Marx, the point being that it was advocated/practiced on the basis of Marxist class-struggle theories BY MARXISTS):

“Karl Marx felt that terror was a necessary part of a revolutionary strategy” (Peter Galvert, “Theories of Terror in Urban Insurrections”, IET, p. 138);

“Revolutionary terrorism has its roots in a political ideology, from the Marxist-Leninist thinking of the Left, to the fascists found on the Right” (Noemi Gal-Or, """"Revolutionary Terrorism"""", IET, p. 203);

“… perhaps the most important key to Stalin’s motivation lies in the realm of ideology. The leitmotif of Soviet communist ideology in the 1920s and 1930s was class struggle – the inbuilt antagonism between mutually incompatible economic interest groups” (Geoffrey Robert, Stalins Wars, 2006, pp. 17-18);

this fact is supported not only by reliable academic sources, but by elementary logic: 

“In 1907 Mehring published in the magazine ‘’Neue Zeit (Vol. XXV 2, p. 164) extracts from a letter by Marx to Weydemeyer dated March 5, 1852. In this letter, among other things, is the following noteworthy observation: … class struggle necessarily leads to the dictatorship of the proletariat …”",0,0,0,0,0,0

Regarding you two non-Urantia Book reading nerds - Wazronk and Richiar - if you play games with what you don't know, then you're in for a fight. First of all, you two idiots, if you even bothered to look at the Urantia Readers-Intl website, you would know that it is not an advertising site, but a legitimate non-profit Urantia organization. Because you are not a member of the Urantia movement, and if you were, we would know who you are, you do not even know the history of the Urantia Readers-Intl - which by the way has a larger dedicated following then either the now falling apart Urantia Book Fellowship, and the failing Urantia Association International. 

For your edification, the Urantia Readers-Intl is the original Urantia Brotherhood from 1950, and the only group still holding the flame of the original Doctrine of Trust from its creation. The Urantia Book Fellowship created itself in 1989 as it broke off from the Urantia Brotherhood and the Urantia Foundation. The Foundation created another group called the Urantia Association International for some ridiculous reason, because they had the legal rights to the Urantia Brotherhood organization, and still do. Nevertheless, the Urantia Association International, as in the same direction as the Urantia Book Fellowship, fell into bad management and nefarious direction, and lost sight of the original Midwayer mandates. As such, the true remaining """"loyalist"""" migrated from the Urantia Brotherhood to the Urantia Association International. 

Over time the Urantia Association International, because of lack of true sagacity, was infiltrated by members of the rebel Urantia Book Fellowship organization. As such, the """"loyalist"""" members to the Urantia movement, many of whom where members of the Urantia Association of Florida, grabbed the torch and reorganized the original Urantia Brotherhood as the Urantia Readers-Intl. Because you two dummies are not a direct part of the Urantia movement, and again we say this because we would know who you are if you were - you do not know who is who and what is what. You don't even know that the Urantia Book Fellowship is a counter Urantia movement organization. But, you are obviously not true thinkers, but that is not the issue. 

The issue is that you two jerks keep deleting our external link from this section. We never deleted your links to the Urantia Book Fellowship, but added are link, not apparent to what place it was, but over and over we find it deleted, so now we have game on... you delete us, we delete you. So, if you put the Urantia Book Fellowship link back in, and keep ours in, the we keep yours in. Because you've pissed us off, if you place the Urantia Book Fellowship link above us, we will place our link above you. This is in retrospect to your piousness. So suffer with it. That's life, and perhaps maybe one of you two idiots will someday realize who the Urantia Readers-Intl really is, who the Urantia Book Fellowship really is, and who is the original group with the original doctrine - but we already know that you two bozos don't have what it takes to figure this out in this life time. The truce is... Urantia Readers-Intl first, Urantia Book Fellowship second, Urantia Association International third... at least for now, then maybe someday we'll swap order, just to appease the dark side. But for now this better be it, or we're going to go back and forth with you wimps and beat you at your own game. Capishe?  02:53, 29""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Relevant/Accurate Facts?
Many of the facts or generalizations are in fact opinions.  For instance, the suggestion that one million dollars is needed to live in the US without working is highly subjective.   (one could live on $500,000 quite easily, based on the average rate of return for conservative investments like mutual funds.)  Furthermore, actual cash is not necessary - many people live comfortably on businesses worth less than $100,000 that they own.

Also, using Marxist language in the initial definition shows a political POV, as in """"The main defining characteristic of the working class is its dependence on wage-labor (or salaried employment) as the main or only source of income, because of lack of capital assets or land that could provide an alternative source of livelihood.""""  In reality, one could argue that the main defining characteristic is simply whether one is in management or whether one uses physical labor or 'brain' labor.  In today's economy, it is not simply the lack of capital assets or land that may indicate working class, but also a lack of marketable knowledge.  You can own 100 acres of rural land in most US states that would be impossible to earn a living on, while having the right knowledge could earn you a living anywhere.

Finally, the alleged sexual habits of the working class (citing research 57 and 32 years old) is irrelevant to this article unless we are going to take the ridiculous practice of defining working class by their sexual habits.  Also, judging certain sexual habits as sophisticated shows a POV and this whole section is childish. 01:11, 16 October 05""",0,0,0,0,0,0

I said it because you reverted some other minor edits as well from my revision which did not require to be reverted. Regarding the timeline, I do consider it relevant in the Mirage-based section, but within its own subsection, with a section header above, and below the text. Otherwise, it would look like an awkwardly positioned navbox in the upper half of the article, when everyone would expect it at the bottom.

 I've seen this with other breeds abroad, unless some people pick them up and promote them, the kennel clubs just don't know they exist. Likewise, with academic studies. I have no idea what family/pack groups they create, or who or what they pack with. I've read a bit about feral dogs in general, and the material is against the idea of their packs. More often just pairs or small groups. This is why I asked. I don't know what IPD do naturally. Joing wolf packs does not sound right. Wolves are known to kill and eat domestic dogs. They are just too different now. But I know it's not enough to guess on the Wikipedia.

 I suspect in cities due to crowding and lots of waste, natural patterns for IPDs are corrupted. Thanks.",0,0,0,0,0,0
