You raise a lot of interesting issues. I'll give my thoughts on some of them. First, I think you're right that """"Eric"""" is, at least in some sense, more readable. Second, you're right that we have article titles like Eric I of Norway and Eric VI of Sweden (but also Eirik II of Norway so it's not quite consistent). I think that a high level of Anglicization is expected for the names of royalty where familiar names tend to be used if at all available. If Eiríkr Hákonarson had ever called himself king I would be fine with having his article at """"Eric II of Norway"""". But he wasn't quite royalty and he is a somewhat more obscure historical character than the kings so I'm not quite sure how to apply this. 

As for medieval usage I haven't made a complete study but what I've seen so far is that the Latin charters witnessed by Eiríkr during his life have """"Yric dux"""" (most commonly) or """"Yrric dux"""" or """"Iric dux"""". The Encomium Emmae, written in Latin in 1041 or 1042, has the form """"Eric"""" and titles him as """"dux et princeps provintiae quae Nordwega dicitur"""".

The Anglo-Saxon chronicle (written in Old English, of course) has """"Irke"""" (a dative form) or """"Yric"""" or """"Yrice"""" (a dative form) or """"Eiric"""". (Maybe I missed a variant.)

Old Norse texts are usually published in normalized orthography where the name is """"Eiríkr"""". In diplomatic editions you will probably find forms like """"Eirikr"""" or """"Eiricr"""" or """"Eirijkr"""" but I don't have any at hand at the moment so don't take it as gospel.

I've got to run now, will address the rest of the question later. I'm actually more worried about the patronym )  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 I'd be happy to work on the lead (or for anyone else to have a go at it), and any suggestions for improvement are always welcome, but it seems absurd for an FA not to have an FA class rating from a related project.  Basically, you're saying your standards are different from community consensus as determined through the FAC (and, in this case, FAR) processes. The two ratings in the mathematics project's grading scheme that are not subjective are FA and GA.  In this case, rather than attempt to unilaterally downgrade the article I think a better approach might have been to raise the issues you see on the talk page (or simply fix them).  In the future if you're hesitant to """"sign"""" an FA or GA rating, then perhaps you should add the rating but not sign it.  Of course, if the mathematics project wants to have its own """"FA"""" sort of rating, that's fine, but then it shouldn't be called FA and shouldn't link to WP:FA.

Any material that is challenged and for which no source is provided may be removed by any editor. So we don't need a poll, all we need is to remove a lot of things from the page. It needs to be rewritten having both published versions, the scientific one and the warmongering story.

In October 2004, Rodríguez filed a civil RICO lawsuit directed against George W. Bush, Richard B. Cheney, Donald H.

no Osama means no Muslims
[FBI says]: The reason why 9/11 is not mentioned on Usama Bin Laden’s Most Wanted page is because the FBI has no hard evidence connecting Bin Laden to 9/11 thus the word Muslim may only be quoted at best.

The use of the word terrorist
Similarities between the Reichstag fire and The September 11 Attacks are as striking as those between the Reichstag Fire Decree and the Patriot act there is no need to use the word terrorist to explain the event, I do think a separate paragraph dedicated to the media calling it a Muslim terrorist attack would be appropriate.

Privacy of names

Caution should be applied when naming individuals who are discussed primarily in terms of a single event. When the name of a private individual has not been widely disseminated or has been intentionally concealed (such as in certain court cases), it is often preferable to omit it, especially when doing so does not result in a significant loss of context. When evaluating the inclusion or removal of names, their publication in secondary sources other than news media, such as scholarly journals or the work of recognized experts, should be afforded greater weight than the brief appearance of names in news stories.

Editors should take particular care when considering whether inclusion of the names of private, living individuals who are not directly involved in an article's topic adds significant value. The presumption in favor of the privacy of family members of articles' subjects and other loosely involved persons without independent notability is correspondingly stronger.",0,0,0,0,0,0

It says to use secondary sources primarily, not exclusively.

Besides it being a rather obvious, observable fact that the new street lights are brighter, we have a reference in that they were claimed to be 'safer' (i.e., provide more light). 

The fact that light pollution is increased with increased brightness is non-arguable, it'd be like saying you have to prove the sun is generally brighter at mid-day. Light pollution has to do with the amount of light used. Newer street light technology produces more light with less energy. The less energy part is great, it's the more light that has to do with light pollution.

How's this: In 2011, the City announced plans to upgrade 80% of its street lighting to new energy-efficient street lights which use induction technology, a modified form of fluorescent lamp that produces a broader spectrum than sodium-vapor lamps. The new system is predicted to save $2.2 million per year in energy and maintenance costs [37], and was proposed to """"make our neighborhoods safer"""" [37] by producing more light, something that also increases [light pollution], while lowering [visual comfort probability]. Wikipedia. Retrieved February 7, 2014.

In 2014, San Diego announced plans to become the first U.S. city to install cyber-controlled street lighting, using an """"intelligent"""" lighting system to control 3,000 LED street lights.[38]

..(Side Note) I found several non-local references while searching for 'street lights controversy', one claimed a battle was 'raging' in communities across the nation, in places that were making the switch to brighter street lighting. It seems to mostly involve people calling and complaining - Complaints in San Diego held back further instillations along Harbor Drive, and the PR person I talked to said he had dealt with tons of complaints; And that was at an early stage of the upgrade. There's also a battle in Sacramento being waged to keep incandescent bulbs from being completely phased out (I wouldn't be surprised if it's not widely covered by the media), because they haven't come up with a non-toxic energy saving bulb (There actually was one being developed, and now I can't find any information about it). I know it to be controversial for many locals, but I can't provide online references, so I'm sticking to basic facts. (End Side Note)

98327d48db048f1a,"Lionel Messi 

Hello Alex, I would like to ask you very politely why you have deleted my passage on Lionel Messi regarding his 'playing style.' With all due respect it is very hard to find evidence of words depicting his playing style whereas the passage I have written clearly shows Messi's ability as any other person with football knowledge would agree. I don't think that there is any evidence apart from video evidence to confirm what I wrote about Messi.
For example passages such as 'he has exceptional dribbling ability, fantastic technique, he likes to cut inside onto his stronger left foot' are clear, direct observations of Messi's playing style for some years. This is confusing for me as of why you had deleted my post as some other users send me a message saying how that it was very helpful and detailed. Also, concerning the evidence problem, would you please kindly replace the passage I wrote because it is not a biased passage and clearly reflects Messi's playing style, I have also used what other commentators have frequently said and if you have ever watched a match with Messi weaving his magic you will know and surely agree along with the millions who watch him that this is a very descriptive, accurate passage about his playing style.
I am very hurt by your edit and deletion and I would ask you to kindly replace this text as it took me a very long time to write. If not, please tell me why or let me speak to someone else who could advise me or who would think I am justified

The Club currently playing at Ibrox is not the Club formed in 1872 so how on earth can the 'Old Firm' term be used as anything other than in the past tense? Would people reporting sightings of Elvios Pressley on the Las Vegas strip 'In Common Speech' be regarded as FACT that he was alive. I rest my case.

Comments on your work as administrator

Now that the dust has cleared a bit, I thought it fitting to give you some feedback on the events of a couple of days ago. Do you know what a kyosaku is? In the zendo, when you """"lose your mind"""", you can request to be struck on the shoulder with a bamboo stick, to recover your alertness. Even if unrequested, I consider the block you imposed on me as a kyosaku, a welcome reminder not to let emotions get the better of me. After all, Wikipedia practice is very much like zen practice: You have to drop your ego to write well, and if done well the writing itself cuts ego further.

Paradoxically, however, that good effect came out of an action that was not so good. It came from an abuse of power, by you against me. When I am dealing with another user who laces his edits with vulgarities and ad hominem attacks, what I expect from the administrators is not one-sided, vindictive reactions, even if for a moment I lose my temper, but even-handed action that restores order and helps everyone maintain the focus on the writing. I am disappointed that you were not able to provide that this time around. I hope that this has been a learning experience for you as it has been for me, and that in the future our interaction will be more constructive than it has been so far.

From the Boston Globe:Lieberman, a Democrat who won reelection as an independent, also said he wants to be called an Independent Democrat.A strong backer of the Iraq war, Lieberman was returned to office on Election Day with strong GOP support. He ran as an independent after he lost the Democratic primary in August to Ned Lamont.He said yesterday on NBC's """"Meet the Press"""" that he will begin his new term as a Democrat because it would make him part of the congressional leadership. The senator is in line to become chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.""""I'm going to caucus with the Democrats both because it's good for my constituents in Connecticut, because I retained my seniority, I become a committee chair, but also I want to continue to work to bring the party back to its historic traditions of strength on national security, foreign policy, and innovation and progress in domestic policy,"""" Lieberman said.He said that because voters returned him to Capitol Hill as an independent, """"I am now an Independent Democrat  capital I, capital D. Matter of fact, the secretary of the Senate called my office and asked, 'How do you want to be identified,' and that's it. Independent Democrat,"""" the senator said.With many Senate Democrats having campaigned or raised money for Lamont, as the party's nominee, Lieberman acknowledged that it might be """"a little awkward"""" for him back in Washington.""""They played by the traditional partisan political playbook. And I can't say I enjoyed it, but we're all grown-ups, we've got a job to do, and I'm going to do my best to get that job done,"""" Lieberman said.Democrats will hold a 51-49 edge in the Senate, so Lieberman, the Democratic nominee for vice president in 2000, could find himself courted by Republicans.He was asked about the possibility that he might switch caucuses if he became uncomfortable as Democrats sought to enforce party discipline, particularly if the GOP offered to keep him as a committee chairman and respect his seniority.""""I'm not ruling it out, but I hope I don't get to that point. And, and I must say, and with all respect to the Republicans who supported me in Connecticut, nobody ever said, 'We're doing this because we, we want you to switch over,' """" he said.""""I believe that the American people are considering both major political parties to be in a kind of probation, because they're understandably angry that Washington is dominated too much by partisan political games, and not enough by problem-solving and patriotism, which means put the country and your state first,"""" Lieberman said.In 2001, Senator James Jeffords [Addition by Hodgdon's secret garden: (""""D."""")] of Vermont abandoned the GOP and aligned himself with the Democrats, putting them in control of the evenly divided Senate. The switch made him a hero among Democrats and a traitor among Republicans.Lieberman said Senator Harry Byrd of Virginia listed himself as an Independent Democrat in the late 1970s. Before that, the last senator to use the designation was in the mid-19th century, he said.link  17:36""",0,0,0,0,0,0

We have one doctor who said Terri was watching him. And we have another doctor who said Terri was cortically blind. We can report those two facts as is. But no one has come out and judged that the autopsy report is right and Cheshire is wrong, so we cannot report that. Since Cheshire and Thogmartin are both doctors, we can't dismiss one out of hand over the other. They both qualify as """"expert testimony"""". If some plumber testified in court that Terri was watching him, then I think we could argue that we could take that out as incorrect information and rely on Thogmartin alone. But this is doctor-versus-doctor, and all we can do is report who said what. As it is now, Cheshire says Terri watched him, and then parenthesis point out the autopsy two weeks later says something different. So, the conflicting facts are present next to each other. That's all we can do and remain npov.  15:21, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Since I heaped praise upon ' for his balanced and non-extremist POV, it is only fair that I give ' credit for not pushing his POV, even though he doesn't appear to me to always abide by this high standard. In rebuttal to , below, I must point out that ALL doctors have an opinion, and while I admit that Cheshire did not examine Terri as much as some doctors, I must point out that:

# Cheshire examined Terri a heck of a lot more than WE did;
# Cheshire is a whole heck of a lot more qualified than WE are (even with my double major in the sciences, biology and chemical science -with honors); and, lastly,
# Any lack of examination on his part is NOT his fault, but the judges' fault (judges, plural possessive), and let's recap.
# Thogmartin and crew were reporting their opinions too.

Besides, Cheshire may NOT have been wrong when he said Terri """"looked"""" at him; Not only could she have turned and """"looked"""" at him by sound cues (3-D hearing depth perception by use of her ears, which were not in question), but also we have found examples in which people with half a brain (or less) have been very successful in life, thus raising the possibility that TERRI could have been able to see, think, feel, etc. (I give credit to other editors, like '''''' who were more resourceful at finding -and posting -examples of cases of """"half-brain, but aware and intelligent people,""""  which I've seen in passing on the Internet.

The converse is true also. I believe the medical literature has reported cases in which the brain looked fairly normal but the person was PVS. In fact, I don't have to go to the medical literature for that one: We have several editors who act and look """"normal"""" but are really PVS. (Yuk, yuk yuk!) 13:""",0,0,0,0,0,0

It does, though, have """"enabling frameworks"""" with a named UK governmental group. The nature of an enabling framework is not specified. Perhaps it just means financial connections? The referenced corporation website (Ah! Gamos must be a corporation!) is filled with similarly non-specific language. Why is it notable? Well, apparently because it somehow """"provoked a multi donor action"""" dealing with African phones. One assumes that this sort of provocation is a good thing, but this is not quite clear. And, further, it was, in some fashion, responsible for a """"Good Practice Paper..."""".

Please, someone, this article desperately need rewriting. It is not really intelligible as it is. Plus, even though some references have been provided to indicate that Gamos exists, there is very little there to show any significant notability. I am replacing the notability tag.

I have proved above that one of your ADMIN is a liar and that he is RIGGING the RFA vote. I have proved beyond a doubt that this is the case. Fo you to come here and indefinitely extend my block shows that you have not read any of my sentiment and you are more intent on flexing your punitive tools. 

This BLOCK stems from an edit conflict wher I reverted something that has since been proven to be a FALSE QUOTE with a PHONEY source. I have made the article more FACTUAL with my persistence. This is why all this has happened. Over zealous ego-maniacal editors have had me blocked for bogus reasons.

It is bothering that the editors seem so intent on flexing their punitive tools rather than actually looking into the claims of someone who is probably agitated rather than being a genuine vandal.

 Masreliez’s theorem 
Hello Doug, first thank you for your sensible recommendations on my talk page on minor edits.

Gregory St. Vincent (Grégoire de Saint-Vincent), with -
The Greeks described a spiral using an angle and a radius vector, but it was St. Vincent and Cavalieri who simultaneously and independently introduced them as a separate coordinate system. In an article The Origin of polar coordinates, J. J. Coolidge refers to the priority dispute between Cavalieri and St. Vincent over their discovery. St. Vincent wrote about this new coordinate system in a letter to Grienberger in 1625 and published the process in 1647. On the other hand Cavalieri's publication appeared in 1635 and the corrected version in 1653.
and Milestones in the History of Thematic Cartography
Development of the use of polar coordinates for the representation of functions. Newton's Method of Fluxions was written about 1671, but not published until 1736. Jacob Bernoulli published a derivation of the idea in 1691. [238,p. 324] attributes the development of polar coordinates to Fontana, with no date.- Isaac Newton  (1643-1727), England, and Gregorio Fontana  (1735-1803) and Jacob Bernoulli  (1654-1705) [238,p. 324]. 1671 is probably too early; 17361755 would probably be more appropriate. There are earlier references to Hipparchus (190-120BC) regarding the use of polar coordinates in establishing stellar positions, and Abu Arrayhan Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Biruni (1021) regarding the use of three rectangular coordinates to establish a point in space.
1843 Use of polar coordinates in a graph(frequency of wind directions)- Léon Lalanne (1811-1892), France [148].
La Habra High School Math History Timeline
Jacob Bernoulli invents polar coordinates, a method of describing the location of points in space using angles and distances.
Sherlock Holmes in Babylon and Other Tales of Mathematical History has a section
Newton as an originator of polar coordinates
Jacob Amsler http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Printonly/Amsler.html
[Amsler] invented the polar planimeter, a device for measuring areas enclosed by plane curves. It was based on polar coordinates whereas earlier instruments were based on cartesian coordinates. In 1856 Amsler published a paper Über das Planimeter in which he gave details of his idea. As Mahoney writes in [1], Amsler's planimeter:- ... adapted easily to the determination of static and inertial moments and to the coefficients of Fourier series: it proved especially useful to shipbuilders and railway engineers.

For 13 days ago there was absolutely nothing more to discuss about, and seeing that, YBM used his ususal tactic who is to do as if they din't have answered the questions at hand, and that way, confuse the other users and make them believe that it was the case, as he has always done since 2003.
Someone has to stand up and say it, someone has to put an end to this circus, and I choose to do so.
I do not have followed the story from the beginning and do not know the Bogdanov but through this affair, that I begin to interest myself with since the beginning og august.
Two things became clear for me as I scanned all the web on the subjects: YBM was the person doing all the staging, and YBM didn't knew what he was talking about. I also found out that no matter how many times and in how many languages and by how many specialists the answers were given to him, he will keep asking and accusing peoples, and agress them personnally and accuse them of not being edicated in that field or critisized their university or making threat at contacting their chiefs, and even insult them to push them away from the discussion platform, as this kind of people represented a real threat to his status.
And of course, especially when we are talking of the scientific platform like in fr. physic or scent physic, those people, phd or professor at university were not used at being roll around with nor being talking to that way and even less at being insulted and confronted with non argumentativ methods.
So they left and never show up again, leeving all free room that YBM could ever wish for to pursue his goal.
But what was this goal exactly?
It wasn't the truth as he kept lying and had been given all answers, and was often denying to have done certain things who were appearing very often.
He was repeating himself and soon I saw a pattern emerging, from all his apparitions on the web, with falsh accusations, lies, home made stories, fantasyfull evidences, links to web sites from his own making, agression, personal attacs, insults.
His goal was not at all to discuss science but to manipulate others and he managed to do so very well as he was allowed to fool so many for such a long time. T>wo years is a very long time for a little subject as this one.
Then I was contacted by people who had been confronted to him, prior to this case, and had been subject to the same attacks and methods on the web.
I stude it, and saw worse than I could ever imagined. It was all planed from the beginning and a part of an ideologie with filosofical pretenses on how one could manipulate other people meaning by creating a situation on line.
It is what they call Post situationism, and wich is issued of Voyer. In the previous case against a teacher that he knew from school and a women writer (on cooking books!) he had just met Voyer but been found of him for a longer time, by the beginning of Bogdanovs affair he had been introduce inside the rangs of Voyer and Co, and as the affair progressed assured himself a high status in this """"confrerie"""".
That is the reason why this article I come with is of such importance. It reveal what was behind all along, what motivated the principal actors of this mascarade, and show all that they have been manipulated from the beginning and still are.
There is no Bogdanov affair, it is an illusion, a part from a group of ideologs making a thinking experiment and giving life to it by means of the internet.
Brillant! Unless there was casualties.
And there is.
Plenty of, and more than the Bogdanovs private sphere and their career.
I was really aroused from the beginning when I realised what YBM was about but even more when I saw what it all was really about, I was shocked by how unpropper and unethical it all was, and what a big unjustice it was to all who were involved in it, and this also include people who have followed and defended the apparent vews of YBM not kn",0,0,0,0,0,0

Ask Nancy: Q/A with Nancy Lieberman
Q: Hi, Nancy. Why do you think the Great Adrienne Goodson of the Sting doesn't get a shot at the National Team? What gives? Yours Truly, -Ralph (Bayonne, N.J.)

A: Speaking from an alumni perspective (Go ODU!), Goodie is a warrior. She won't get a lot of attention, but she just goes about the work and grinds it out. That is why I was really happy that she made the All-Star team in 2002. It just validated how good of a player she really is. People always underestimate her, but she is so mentally tough. She will never get a lot of exposure, but she is vital to the success of the WNBA.    Source: http://aol.wnba.com/features/asknancy_040721.html

JERSEY CITY, NJ - 05/06/2003…Adrienne is often compared to her cousin, Dennis “Lil Pie” Goodson.  His alma mater, New Jersey City University (Jersey City State College) unveiled the newly created Dennis Goodson Memorial Basketball Award, at the Annual Athletic Awards Banquet in 2003.  Dennis competed as a point guard with the school from 1983 to 1987 and was a starter on the school's first Final Four team in 1986. Sadly, he died on June 25, 2002 at the age of 36.  
 
Named in honor of the star point guard, the award is bestowed to either a male or female basketball player at NJCU. The recipient will best exemplify the attributes for which Goodson was known: team loyalty, dedication to the sport of basketball, competitive spirit on the court, knowledge of the fundamentals of basketball, and demonstration of leadership, and sportsmanship.

It is the summer of 2009.  The decision to continue COTS funding comes accross President Clinton's desk.  She passes it off to some staffer who happens to be a man hating feminist.
For starters this lady views rockets as phallic shaped symbols of male power with flames coming out one end.  A lot of people read wikipedia and your embarrasing discussion is only one click away from the main article.
She soon learns from the bold headlines that these are not just rockets, they are Big FUCKING Rockets.  Big FUCKING Phallace shaped flame shooting rockets made by a male dominated industry.  She makes her recomendation to Clinton
and Bye Bye COTS funding.  Now is that what anyone hear wants.  Why don't you guys go ask your wives if they think the wrong kind of woman might be offended by this.

this was a good idea that went wrong; turning into a list of every anime on the planet. It also excluded anime with major significance (sailor moon mainly) under the sole reason of not liking sailor moon. Shows with multiple titles/seasons were often mistakenly labled as seperate shows (of which teh origional author's reasoning was quite laughable). THere was also no format determining which shows made the list and which didn't. All this resulted in people adding random shows that do not matter/removing shows that matter and adding overall incorrect information.

To correct his, i have reformatted the list. By merging shows with multiple seasons (expanding an origional storyline), removing shows that do not make the ANN top 500 in some way shape or form, and limiting the episode count to 48 (a regular anime season in japan) i hope to have corrected any problems with this article.

Ms. Barber said: """"Then there are the 'self' proclaimed """"registries"""" that will issue a piece of paper to anyone that sends them some cash!  They are a BIG joke in the """"official"""" dog world, and there is a lot of Internet verification regarding all of them!!""""

Ms. Barber said: """"I am sure that the TSSR, NSBR, SSBA, etc. have convinced themselves that they *are* registries, but I can also assure you that no other legitimate organization, like the UKC .. AKC .. FCI .. etc. would agree with them!! Just because someone says something (and it's not illegal) that does not *make* it so!!"""" 

Jareth: (see above) Ms. Barber has repeatedly and continuously made personal attacks about other registries and should be banned by you for doing so.  She should be subject to the same rules/restrictions to which the other contributors to this discussion have been held. Wiki has not allowed others to address Ms. Barber's questionable registry/club/breeding practices, so why is she being allowed to continue to do so? 

And, despite being the """"first"""" registry, what independent, unbiased documentation has the ISSR provided to show that they are any """"different"""" or more """"recognized"""" than any other Shiloh registry, when it comes to accreditation by any outside organization. The fact of the matter is, the ISSR is no more """"recognized"""" independently than any of the other Shiloh registries currently in operation.

Also, like the 'self' proclaimed registries Ms. Barber references, the ISSR also issues its own """"pieces of paper"""" based on Ms. Barber's own determination and her registry charge for these """"pieces of paper"""".  What Ms. Barber is claiming about other registries (""""Just because someone says something [and it's not illegal] that does not *make* it so!!""""), is true of her own, as she has repeatedly throughout this discussion failed to provide unbiased, independent (as you stipulated as a rule for the inclusion of information or contribution) corroboration that her organization is any different.

In addition, the article, as now changed again, with Ms. Barber's numerous links to her own registry's/club's website are again both self-promoting and an attempt to steer readers to her business and to hinder Wikipedia's policy of """"neutrality"""" in its articles.  These links are not unbiased, factual, neutral information.  Readers wishing to pursue more information re: her club/registry have the link at the bottom of the article (along with the other registry/club links) they can access if they want to hear more from her.

At this stage, I think it is obvious that Ms. Barber has no intention of negotiating and compromising, in good faith and mutual respect, a """"neutral"""", factual, independent, unbiased article. I commend you for your patience and efforts, thank you for your assistance and recommend this process move forward to the next step of arbitration. M.Dúfy""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Zhongnanhai / """"China White House""""
The location of the headquarters offices of the Communist Party is to the West of the Southwest corner of the forbidden city. Here is that info from Google.com 

Zhongnanhai 
The Zhongnanhai is a complex of buildings in Beijing, China adjacent to the Forbidden City which serves as the central headquarters for the Communist Party of China and the government of the People's Republic of China. The term Zhongnanhai is synonymous with the leadership and government administration of the nation, and is often used as a metonym for the Chinese leadership at large (in the same sense that the term White House frequently refers to the President of the United States and his associates). Chinese Presidents, including Hu Jintao, and other top PRC leadership figures carry out many of their day-to-day administrative activities inside the compound, such as meetings with foreign dignitaries. However, the complex is shrouded in some mystery as it is closed to the general public, with photography additionally being strictly curtailed at several prominent locations such as the main gate. However, China Central Television frequently shows footage of meetings inside the compound, but limits its coverage largely to views of the interior of buildings.

   2. If the material is longer than a sentence, list your objections on the Talk page but leave the main article as it is.

Then, wait a bit for responses. If no one objects, proceed. But always move large deletions to Talk and list your objections to the text so that other people will understand your changes and will be able to follow the history of the page.

Also, show respect for consensus. Avoid making major changes to an article if a vote (or poll) is currently in progress about whether those changes should be made, especially if there is no clear consensus shown by the vote.

According to WP:LINKSTOAVOID article 2: """"Any site that misleads the reader by use of factually inaccurate material or unverifiable research"""" cannot be included in wikipedia.  has purposefully breached this policy in his continuing personal vendetta against me. Here is the proof:

After repeatedly being warned by myself against the misleading and factually inaccurate material presented on an external webpage Janet Marlow's site admin  still intentionally linked to this misinformative page in the following edit: 

 

 has since made the (above) statement: """"there is no misinformation on the particular page to which I linked. Both sides are describing the same eight notes being provided by the same four resonant strings. Whether that is four """"resonances"""" or eight is a non-issue.""""

Not only is  mistaken in claiming that there is no misinformation on the page, or that the two sides in the argument are describing the same thing, he has clearly been abusing his status as an administrator. Let us first consider the contents of this argument:

The page to which  linked makes the following claims:

""""Therefore, there are four missing sympathetic resonances on the six string guitar. If you play a C,  Bb, Ab, and Gb on the first string E,  there will be less sustain from these notes than the others because there are no sympathetic resonant strings. This was Maestro Yepes’ primary reason for conceiving the ten-string guitar. By adding these pitches in four extra bass strings, now provides each half step with the sympathetic resonance making a more physically completed instrument."""" (Janet Marlow Janet Marlow's site)

Now, in western classical music there are 12 notes in the octave: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B. If it is claimed (as above) that four of these notes lack resonances, then logically/mathematically, this means that the other eight out of the twelve do not lack resonances. Marlow lists the four missing resonances as C, Bb (=A#), Ab (=G#), and Gb (=F#) and states that """"there will be less sustain from these notes than the others"""". Any person who is a competent speaker of the English language will understand this as meaning that these four listed notes have more sustain (more resonance) than the other notes, the """"other notes"""" being C#, D, D#, E, F, G, A, B. In other words, Marlow is claiming four notes don't have resonance and eight do.

However, Narciso Yepes (who invented the modern 10-string guitar) always, ubiquitously and verifiably talked about eight missing sympathetic resonances on the guitar, not four as claimed by Marlow. Yepes lists the eight missing resonances as C, C# (=Db), D# (=Eb), F, F# (=Gb), G, G# (=Ab), A# (=Bb). He lists the other four notes that do have resonance as D, A, E, and B. Yepes's quotes from numerous articles/interviews can be read here  with references to follow them up. There is also further information on my site www.tenstringguitar.INFO about the acoustics, the science behind Yepes's statements.

Janet Marlow (and ) are clearly, in fact, not saying the same thing as Narciso Yepes (and Viktor van Niekerk). Both sides are certainly not """"describing the same eight notes being provided by the same four resonant strings"""", as  is falsely claiming. If they were describing the same thing, Marlow would have to speak of eight missing resonances (C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, G, Ab, Bb) not only four (C, Bb, Ab, Gb).

 only goes on to claim that """"Whether that is four """"resonances"""" or eight is a non-issue"""" because to admit the truth - that it is very much an issue and a source of misinformation - would reveal his involvement in not only deliberately promoting misinformation on wikipedia (going against WP:LINKSTOAVOID article 2), but also misusing his status as an administrator to abuse me in his ongoing personal vendetta over an edit disagreement. This defamatory conduct includes, but is hardly limited to his claim (below) that Janet Marlow """"is a more authoritative figure than Viktor"""", despite the fact that Marlow has been proven to publish misinformation while my website www.tenstringguitar.INFO is presently the only online resource that faithfully represents Narciso Yepes's statements about his invention as well as a scholarly explanation of the",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Éamonn McCann on RSF and Political Legacy of 1916 

ÉRSF 'AUTHENTIC CLAIMANTS TO POLITICAL LEGACY OF 1916 RISING' 

WRITING in the Sunday edition of the Derry Journal journalist and author Éamonn McCann said that in his view, as far as Republicanism was concerned, the most authentic claimants to the political legacy of the 1916 Rising were Ruairí Ó Brádaigh and Republican Sinn Féin. 

He said: """"The Proclamation didn't promise a fight to achieve the Republic. It proclaimed the Republic as an actually-existing entity. It is for this reason that IRA volunteers ever since have pledged not to strive for the achievement of the Republic but to defend the Republic already achieved. In this perspective, a deal which others might see as a step towards the ultimate objective will be seen as contemptible retreat from the struggle. 

""""In detaching himself from the Provisionals in 1986 because they'd accepted the legitimacy of the Leinster House parliament, Ó Brádaigh stood by the Republic established on Easter Monday. Looked at from this angle - as legitimate an angle as any other - there is no question: Mr Ó Brádaigh and his followers stand alone in true succession to Easter Week. 

""""Those of us who stand rights outside the Republican tradition and who take a socialist view also see Easter Week in the perspective of our own politics, see its enduring legacy in the fact that it was a blow against the most powerful Empire on earth at the time, and regard it as self-evident that its spirit is best represented today in the fight against the imperial power of the US ruling class. 

""""In this view, the most egregious betrayal of 1916 lies not in grudgingly taking seats in a partitionist parliament but in cheerfully breaking bread with George W Bush."""" 

The Sunday Journal also carried an article entitled """"We're the true inheritors of 1916""""' - Derry Republican Sinn Féin"""" on page 4. 

""""Plans by the Irish Government to celebrate the 1916 Easter Rising are hypocritical, a Derry Republican Sinn Féin (RSF) activist has suggested. 

Derry based spokesman for the movement, Richard Walsh says that RSF are the only true inheritors of the historic insurrection and the proclamation of independence. He hit out at the 26-County Administration for """"war-crimes"""" against those who believed in the ideals of the uprising during the Civil War. 

He said: """"There has been much talk of late about the legacy of the Easter Rising of 1916. 

""""Bertie Ahern has announced plans by the 26-County State to commemorate 1916 with a Free State military parade. 

""""Let no-one forget that it was the Free State Army that executed four Republican soldiers in Co. Donegal by firing squad in 1923 as a reprisal for Republican military operations. True Republicans commemorate the Drumboe Martyrs at Eastertide every year. 

""""The Staters were also responsible for many other war-crimes such as the Ballyseedy massacre in Co. Kerry (also in March, 1923), where eight Republican soldiers were killed whilst strapped to a landmine by Free State forces - miraculously leaving one survivor."""" 

He added that the 26-County government cannot claim ownership to the legacy of the Easter Rising. 

""""Those who not only betrayed the All-Ireland Republic - proclaimed in arms at Easter 1916, endorsed by the people of Ireland in 1918, and effectively established by Dáil Éireann in January, 1919 - but also actively waged war against it cannot claim the legacy of 1916. 

""""These people continue to imprison Republicans by using the Special non-jury Court in Dublin - the same building in which Robert Emmet was sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered by the English - on the basis of the opinion of the 26-County police [Gardaí]."""" 

He added that the Republican Movement, on the other hand, had """"remained loyal to the Republic of Clarke; Mac Diarmada; Mac Donagh; Pearse; Ceannt; Connolly and Plunkett, and have commemorated the 1916 Rising every year since. 

""""Those who have maintained this continuity are the true inheritors of the noble ideals of 1916.""""  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Response to block on 2009-February-12

Tattle-telling
[ My talk page history] shows that a talkback was placed on my page on 13:26 for [ a comment that was posted on 13:25]. This shows that  manually placed the talkback in my talk page in order to call attention. He certainly doesn't want to make friends with me, so who is supposed to see it?

The block was enacted in haste
[ My block log] shows that the block was enacted at 14:08, whereas the complaint was posted to [ WP:WQA] at 14:46. Why would someone respond to a request from the future ??

Complaint to WP:WQA
Initial complaint
This may have been forum shopping, in response to a seemingly ignored plea. This is also about SarekOfVulcan's statements, which show bad faith overall. Blocking me first and then posting the complaint would amount to censorship, since I would only be able to refute the claims in my talk page, and through unblock requests. This risks my being blocked from my own talk page.

From [ oldid=270227244]:

""""lots of civility violations""""
Starts off using hyperbole

""""I'd honestly like him to settle down and become a productive member of Wikipedia""""
False statement; he worked diligently to get me blocked. Lack of """"useful contributions"""" cited as a reason for blocking, which is also false

""""if we can't defend our arguments against determined opposition, are they really any good?""""
Vague statement. I have agreed on some points in the talk page, while many others have gone undisputed. The other users seem to disagree with everything I say. Whatever is not disagreed never gets a response

""""I see him getting indef-blocked within the month. Can somebody ... point him in the right direction? Make sure you read all of the discussion, so he can't accuse you of only reading the scandalous parts""""
Defamation

""""has called other editors liars""""
A false inference

""""appealed a block on the grounds that, essentially, the Masons made Elonka block him.""""
Another false inference. He has cited unrelated sysop actions not involving him, in unusual detail, which shows malice or, at the least, stalking

""""Last night, I noticed that he had added a bunch of references to Daigo Umehara that included exlinks in the authorlink field, so I cleaned them up, removing only the authorlinks. """"
I never asked for his help, and he never suggested the change to me. Template:Cite web doesn't say that it's prohibited, simply that it doesn't work, which is usually OK. This means that his changes were not in good faith. He admits to following me to a page that I was working on, to do nothing but """"remove links."""" This is a form of harassment

Additions to the WQA complaint
In [ oldid=270230275] he added
Previous discussion here at archive 57.SarekOfVulcan (talk) 
which was a discussion irrelevant to the current situation.

Deletion of the WQA complaint
In  he saw it fit to completely delete the request, stating, """"blocked for two weeks: no action needed""""

From 
""""Was that in response to my WQA filed involving those two diffs? If not, I'll just remove it before anyone comments.""""
This is evidence tampering. Deleting it would be sensible, if one argues that his post is not even evidence.

In addition, he has described my posting to WP:ANI as """"amusing"""" in [ Blueboar's talk page] and [ MSJapan's talk page].

The article in question
Masonic conspiracy theories
It is part of the Freemasonry Wikiproject, and all of the editors are Freemasons. They have created a cabal to stop me from making what I believe to be neutral edits.

WP:COI concerns and solutions for this article
User:Lordradish asked a question about my possible conflict of interest - WP:COI.  First, always look at Wikipedia policies if you think there is an issue, don't just go away angry. I know that I'm still learning Wikipedia policies and just reading the above I can see that in 2007-2008 period I was somewhat confused about a couple of them. The longer you are here, the more sensitive you become to all of them through experience.

Re: COI questions, usually its better to start that on a talk page per WP: """"The first approach should be direct discussion of the issue with the editor, referring to this guideline."""" Actually, I thought this issue explicitly had been dealt with here before, but reading through I see I evidently confused it with a related COI question elsewhere. Anyway, I'll respond in interest of full disclosure, outline questions I think have to be asked on the talk page of any editor here who gives any indication of being familiar with the issue, and suggest some possible ways of dealing with WP:COI issues here.

My possible WP:COI
To answer Lordradish's question, I have contributed 43 blog entries to the secessionist blog Vermont Commons over the last 38 months. I have not been paid.  My blog entries have been more generally related to the topic of secession and occasionally make passing references to Vermont and its secession issues, including in comments on others' entries. I don’t live in Vermont and don't intend to. I don't consider myself a member of any Vermont Secession group. As far as I remember, I only have corresponded with the Vermont Commons editor, and that by email. I get some irregular Vermont Commons email and mailings and occasional Second Vermont Republic snail mails. 
I also have suffered a couple years of vicious and even libelous off wiki attacks from the anonymous blogger who does vermontsecession.blogspot, including because I edited this page, and including at another blogspot page he set up just to ridicule me with incredible sexist ire. Therefore I have come to know far more about what types of individuals may be making very POV and COI edits to this article than I would have otherwise.
I do feel I have sufficient COI to make sure I declare it, as I now have, and to be very careful of my edits per WP:COI#Editors_who_may_have_a_conflict_of_interest. 

Possible WP:COI of other editors 
In the 2007-2008 period there was some extreme POV editing of this article by individuals who I believe had very strong personal and financial connections to Vermont organizations and individuals, far stronger than mine. They are strongly motivated to trash or downplay the significance of Second Vermont Republic and don't care much about Wikipedia policies.  Therefore here are some questions that might have to be asked on such suspected persons' talk pages (or here, but guidance on that appreciated). And I hope it’s ok to outline these general questions given the track record of this particular article.

General questions include: are you the anonymous blogger who does vermontsecession.blogspot.com which, while using some information from reliable sources, has a track record of unrelenting nasty, exaggerated and unprofessional attacks on individuals, often with little or even contrary evidence presented; is that person a close personal associate?; do you work for or with that person in some other capacity, such as at a publication or a blog or a sometimes paid campaign staffer?; are you a Democratic or Republican Party activist or contractor or potential contractor who fears that secession candidates running in 2012 might take votes away from Democratic Party candidates and throw the election to a Republican. (According to official returns the candidate Pete Garritano mentioned in th is article got 3.7% of the returns, something not yet in the article.)  Depending on whether a candidate was a more right or left winging secessionist, such a 2012 candidate could away enough votes to sway an election to the opponent of someone support by the editor.

If other editors who seem to be too pro-Vermont Secession arise, obviously relevant questions could be asked of them on their talk page or here.

Dealing with special WP:COI concerns of this article
Given the problems described above, I can think of possible solutions:
 I am going to ask some neutral editors - those who have not been active opining on the secession topic or me - to look at this section and opine.
 If Wikipedia:Pending changes is implemented, this article may need to be put on the list.

I'm finding the Irsish/ Northern Irish issue quite hard work.

RE your new edit - I don't understand now how all Northern Irish are Irish full-stop. Surely you need a papers to be a citizen of any country? Can you explain it to me here, or ideally on the Biography MOS talk page, where I made this subsection on Northern Ireland. At the moment the words Northern Irish links to this anchor link on """"Citizenship and identity"""" which talks about an 'entitlement' to 'claim' Irish citizenship.

 Lyrics 
I see you're removing a bunch of links to song lyrics. What evidence do you have that they are copyright violations?  

Same question as above, what's up with this?  Although not allowed on wikipedia, the fair use rational is pretty established for lyric sites, and having a link is pretty benificial to these articles.  Let me know what's up... -rex 

This was discussed here, and fair use is not established for lyric sites. None of those sites are authorized by the copyright holders (just go there and look for their copyright notices), and many of them are profiting from their copyright violations through ads. See this site, the MPA or the BBC for more information. Ideally, all those links should be replaced with links to the lyrics page on the musician/band's official website.  (Talk) 

I forgot to cite WP:EL:
A page that violates the copyrights of others per contributors' rights and obligations. Sites which fail to provide licensing information or to respond to requests for licensing information should not be used. (Knowingly and intentionally directing others to a site that violates copyright has been considered a form of contributory infringement in the United States.).
 (Talk) 

I'm not sure I trust the MPA on this one... -rex 

Of course I don't agree with the MPA, but this is not a good reason to violate WP:EL (or the current copyright laws). If readers want to see the lyrics, and we can't link to them, they can still use Google. It's not that difficult.  (Talk) 

I see it more as a reason to change WP:EL then -rex 

Then I suggest that you make a proposal at Wikipedia talk:External links.  (Talk) 

Mushroom, I tend to agree that lyrics and links to lyrics sites should be removed from articles; however, it seems excessive to remove them from users' comments on talk pages. In two cases, I had actually been using azlyrics for this quote:

United States Copyright Law provides the copyright owner and/or their representative with the exclusive right to create, reproduce and distribute derivative works based on copyrighted material. Unless you have received permission from the copyright owner or their representative to distribute the lyrics from their songs, you are in violation of the law.
May 2003 - Azlyrics.com Team was contacted by one of the world's largest music print publisher """"Hal Leonard Corporation"""", who exclusively control print rights for more than 6000 of the compositions listed on our website. Publisher demand us to cease and desist from offering these unauthorized lyrics for distribution via our website.
We had no choice but to remove all these lyrics from our site, otherwise AZLyrics.com would be closed.

As you can see, this actually supports your case. Assuming you simply failed to read what I wrote, I reverted both of your changes.

In this case, I didn't revert; however, I would urge you to do so yourself. Talk pages are not part of the encyclopedic content, and don't have to adhere to the same guidelines as articles do.

Thanks for taking this task upon yourself, but please keep in mind that this issue is shadowy, not at all black-and-white. cιτγ 

I actually read what you wrote (I even visited the site and read the paragraph you quoted), and I decided to remove the link anyway, because I think those sites should not get any traffic from Wikipedia. I agree that in this case the removal was not justified, since you were linking to a non-copyvio page, but I won't revert my edits to other talk pages. As WP:EL says, ''""""knowingly and intentionally direct",0,0,0,0,0,0

Actually, this is not at all a contentious issue. Don't go by the talk page comments. If you have facts to the contrary you should present them. There are other authors who explicitly says this. They are reputed too. They tick all the boxes of WP:RS. But, they are themselves Yadavs, and others don't have the reputation Rao enjoys. So, I am not sure if i should use those sources. However, you should present something if you think, people have stated anything contrary. In fact, MSA Rao merely compiles what Bhandarkar and others have already established. You should have a look into the deleted Ahirs as Yadav section. This will clear a lot of your doubts. I am interested in bringing back the entire section and not just a statement. This topic exists as a subject and should contain all the arguments by different scholars, going into finer points of this aspect.  No-Blast """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Summary of proposed edit

Hello! I am a student at Drake University enrolled in a Wikipedia:Wiki Ed/Drake University/Global Youth Studies (Fall 2015):course that is striving toward taking out the systemic bias out of Wikipedia. My proposed edit is not extensive yet, but I am using my sources to explain the global side of popular music. It also explains how it is difficult to label something as popular music or not. I touched on the connection between world music and being labeled as an """"exotic other."""" I chose a couple of genres of music that are popular in different countries to explain how something may be popular in one context, but not another. The edit also discusses how the digitization of music has impacted the popular music field by allowing artists to become famous through social media. I am still not totally confident with my edit because it is very short at this point and I am nervous that I am trying to discuss different genres too in depth. I am also nervous that I am trying to make an argument out of this article because I am discussing the different countries' popular music genres. Later this week or this weekend I will be linking my proposed edit to this talk page. Thank you!   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Speedy deletion of Lev Nikolaevich Korolev
 A tag has been placed on Lev Nikolaevich Korolev requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section G12 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be a blatant copyright infringement. For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material, and as a consequence, your addition will most likely be deleted. You may use external websites as a source of information, but not as a source of sentences. This part is crucial: say it in your own words.

If the external website belongs to you, and you want to allow Wikipedia to use the text — which means allowing other people to modify it — then you must include on the external site the statement """"I, (name), am the author of this article, (article name), and I release its content under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 and later."""" You might want to look at Wikipedia's policies and guidelines for more details, or ask a question here. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

Pig War is curious and has a great potential! that is, the article. Two words of note:
 Don't insert links to wikipedia articles in footnotes. Use direct links to actual sources (or reference to printed sources). A reference linking just """"Statistik Austria"""" makes an impression of a fake ref, and few people will care to explore the subject in depth. These will be reverted on sight.
 Have some consideration as to where you insert links to the article. Some of these look like spamming. The 1906 affair has little relevance for post-war Austria - the economic growth after the Anschluss and the destruction of 1945 were orders of magnitude higher than any event preceding WW1.

 Tie-break rules in basketball  

Can you give me the exact rules of this situation because I found this:

1) If 2 teams have the same record, the team that won the head to head game wins
the tie breaker.
2) If there are more than 2 teams with the same record, then the tie breaker will be
decided by the point difference in all games played. Please look at the chart below
for an example. All 3 teams ended with 2 wins and 2 loses.
# Team A Team B Team C1 Win + 2  Lose 15   Win +252Lose –10 Lose –9 Lose –33Win +5  Win +7  Lose –24 Lose –2  Win +10  Win + 11Diff. –5  –9  +31

So in this example, Team C would win the tie breaker with +31, Team A will be second
with -5, and Team B will be last with -9.

Well, Stricker actually has a finding of research misconduct against him ; he fudged data to get an NEJM paper that was retracted by his three co-authors when they found out what he did: .  As a consequence, was barred by the ORI from receiving or applying for federal grants for three years in the 1990s.  So he's previously gotten into serious trouble for throwing out data that doesn't fit his preferred hypothesis.
In recent years, his publications seem to be almost exclusively low-impact papers, opinion bits, and letters related to Morgellons and the related dubious diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease.  I suppose it's possible that he might be """"leading his field"""", but if so it's taking an awfully long time for anyone to start following.  It's looking much more like he's just wandering in the wilderness.
And the advent of the """"open-peer-review"""" journals (where the journal publicly posts the identities and sometimes the comments of peer reviewers) opens a window on at least some mild shenanigans regarding reviewer selection in some of his recent papers.  This 2013 F1000 paper has a publisher's note about an undisclosed conflict of interest, where one of the reviewers was co-authoring another manuscript with the paper's authors while reviewing the F1000 paper.  And one of the reviewers of the current paper (BMC Dermatology, 2015) was Robert Bransfield , who is actually acknowledged in the paper (!) () for his contributions.  This sort of thing has a couple of likely explanations—Stricker (et al.) are deliberately pointing journal editors at very friendly peer reviewers (and these mostly-crappy, low-impact journals don't do much due diligence), potential conflicts of interest be damned; or these papers are so far out on the fringe that it's very difficult for journal editors to find anyone who is willing to waste time on reviewing manuscripts on these topics, so they're relaxed about their reviewer standards; or both.

 Eastern Orthodox Church and other Eastern Churches 

I am not a writer or an editor, so I am not sure how to approach the correction of the page, nor am I a genealogist or a theologian, so I'm not really schooled in the subject matter, so I could be wrong about this.
  In the article under the heading of Eastern Orthodox Church and other Eastern Churches, it says """"However, in the Eastern Orthodox Church, marriages of affinity that produce children who are closer genetic relatives than legal are also not permitted (unless the genetic relationship does allow marriage between those children).  For example, two siblings may not marry two other siblings because legally their children will be cousins, but genetically they'll be half siblings.  On the other hand, two siblings may marry two cousins.""""
  Although I am not sure what the laws are in the EOC regarding marriage of first cousins, I believe the example given is in error.  Half siblings are children who share one parent, either the father or the mother.  I believe that their children would in fact be cousins in two lines.  However, according to the Wikipedia page on siblings, two of the siblings in the scenario were identical twins, this would in fact make their children genetically equivalent to half siblings, as well as cousins.
  As for the second example, of two siblings marrying two cousins, their children would be first cousins in one line, and second cousins in the other line.
  Again, I have never formally studied genealogy, and have no references, so don't take this as an affront, but I think I am correct.

Thank you.

 Learn to read. I said that Paine and Jefferson came up with the ideas for a minarchist government whereby the freedom and equality of the people would  be protected. Have you read Paine and Jefferson? You are attacking the wrong men. If you want to rightfully attack an American forefather attack Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, and others.
 I never said they were anarchists. I do say, though that Jefferson expressed his admiration for anarchism. If he had suggested it at a congressional meeting he probably would have been shot or lynched or they just would have impeached him. (Something that many of them wanted to do anyway.)
 Being patriotic to your country and anarchism are not mutually exclusive. Sounds like you have been reading too much Communist propaganda. Communists just love to subvert governments and China is trying to subvert this one right now. I personally would love to overthrow the fascist-socialist state we're in right now and get back our freedom. But Maoism is not something I would have in mind in the way of freedom.
 Blah and Bockade, since you think you know the ideologies that are best for me, let me find one for you. Hmm, maybe subverting your current government into a dictatorshiptotalitarian state would be appropriate. Or perhaps, as you are incapable of reading comprehension or the most rudimentary thought, working in a convenience store, rather than editing what used to be an encyclopedia would be a good idea for you. Or maybe, how about going and fucking yourself. Now, after having  baited me with your ignorant and idiotic comments, go running to the admins and report me for PAing you, thereby proving beyond any shadow of a doubt how unanarchistic yet socialistic you really are.

Apparantly, Aaron this article is the way you'' want it to be, just to get some accuracy into your last comment.

I have removed various references to songs that contain the progression for only very short, irrelevant sections of the songs. Why? So glad to answer.

 The """"source"""" given is Music Notes' sheet music, which is a website that produces and sells arrangements of songs and nowhere states to be a faithful record of the song as written.
 The Music Notes snippet shown is not enough to show that the song generally uses (or does not use) this four-chord convention.
 The Music Notes are basically just appended on with no proof whatsoever that they show that the song uses the four-chord progression. I could find the sheet music for any musical work you can think ofsay, Beethoven's Ninthand just tack on the Music Notes. Nobody's going to pay five bucks to read it (myself included) to verify.
 Those very same Music Notes do not even uphold the article's assertion in cases like Don't Stop Believing. See measure 7? That's a G#m chorda iii chord, which is not in the pop-punk progression. (G# in the bass, with G#, B and D# in the treble. Straight up G#m chord. Definitely a iii.)

I'll be restoring the removals presently, I guess. Slash """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Wikipedia is no different and should you care to show me how it has effective controls to prevent some know-it-all or other from controlling 'the board' as it were, I'd be happy to listen.

 Thermological explanation of galling 
Hi. I´m responsible for most of the text regarding the galling phenomenon presently found in the Wiki archive. 

My opinion of the galling phenomenon is the following. Galling is highly connected to thermal or pressurized influenced contact and the interaction between the mating surfaces. The temperature or pressure around penetrating objects is higher for small and sharp objects compared to larger blunt objects due to higher acceleration. This means that phase transition can take place even in the initial build up process and onset of adhesive material transfer and galling. It was clear that a change in material behaviour, which increased resistance for further advancement, took place around sharp edges even in the build up process where attached material was insignificant. My conclusion, there is a connection between the attached material and the geometrical situation around penetrating objects and developed pressure and temperature in the contact zone. 
The theory about electrolyte and a galvanic exchange is interesting but in my research using a SOFS (slider-on-flat-surface) tribo-tester, revealed a clear difference between exhibited contacts found in the tracks after testing. An electrolyte and a galvanic exchange should always be present, which was not observed using the above equipment. 

If you are interested in the argumentation read the reference and perhaps include it as a reference in the Wiki text about galling.

I am not a royalist by heart but I am by head. There is great value when there is a non political Head of State and her having many hats as it were has greatly benefited (IMHO) all her realms. The Queen has been faultless as far as I am aware in handling this juggling act. And part of the reason for that is because she does take her other roles very seriously. Apparently it sometimes annoys UK Prime Ministers when she swaps hats and speaks to them on behalf of some country other than the UK. They get an unfair advantage in that sense because the Queen meets with the UK Prime Minsister weekly. In practical matters the legal situation is very clear and the Queen takes her various roles very seriously indeed. To suppose otherwise is pure devilment.,0,0,0,0,0,0

 References to GNU C-Graph 
Long before I wrote the proposed article """"GNU C-Graph"""", I included references under the articles Convolution theorem and Convolution for the benefit of students and their professors teaching and learning about convolution. These references were removed by  and . Notwithstanding my belief that GNU C-Graph meets the WP:Notability criteria,  pointed out """"external links aren't required to be WP notable, just relevant"""".

Most reasonable people would agree that removing the reference to the only software that easily demonstrates the convolution theorem would be a disservice to the public. The text of the references reads:

Under Convolution#External_links:
GNU C-Graph, a free software package for visualizing the convolution theorem, and displaying signals with their spectral plots.

Under Convolution_theorem#Additional_resources:

 Misrepresentation of Women in Football 

Hi Johan. I have some serious concerns about the (probably unintentional) misogynistic POV in Football Project articles and am hoping to enlist your cooperation.  I've attempted, over the past year, to begin correcting the biased POV by:
including women in football articles that previously made it seem as if only men play football or only men play well
creating new content/articles about women's football (e.g.: history, national teams and international competition)
wikifying articles related to women and football

I appreciate your passion for football and the enormous effort you've put into maintaining articles, the portal and the project.  But, it is disconcerting to find my work undone without so much as an attempt to collaborate or find ways to improve the representation of women in Wikipedia football articles. Reverting to the biased content on women's role in soccer (Football (soccer) culture article) as """"soccer mom or fan"""" is a violation of NPOV.  And removing the Norwegian Premier League for women link from the Women's football around the world article is counter-productive, in the most generous interpretation.  Perhaps it was not your intention to do anything POV.  I would appreciate if you'd collaborate.  Would you consider helping by finding a group of editors interested in improving the representation of women in football articles?  Thanks.  Deebki """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I removed the importance banner from the Dade Behring entry because I was editing the article.  The only reason that I even started the article is because the company is mentioned in the Emil Adolf von Behring article and I thought that people who read his entry may be interested in the company.  I dont have the time to sit down and write the whole entry so I put up the incomplete banner.  When I read the importance banner and the page that goes with it(that says:""""This Wikipedia article or category is currently inactive and is kept primarily for historical interest."""") I thought that since I was going to edit the article, the banner could come down.  In the next few days I will closely read up on Notability and edit or remove the article.  Thanks for your input.

 Negative capability as a social theory 

Negative capability is more fully articulated as a social theory by Roberto Unger in his work on false necessity. It differs slightly from Keats in that he uses it to describe the individual's challenge to an existing social order and the capacity to collapse the distance between a context-preserving routine and a context-transforming challenge. In this way it is less about uncertainty and more about a state of empowering resistance, albeit not necessarily within a stable institutional space. 

I am prepared to add Unger's use of negative capability to this entry, but not sure how to integrate it to what is already here. On the one hand it is much more developed than anything Keats produced, but also done so in a different context. In this manner, relegating Keats to background section of the entry might not work (nor would it really do justice to the legacy of poetry and English litalthough this part of the entry needs to be developed more). So, any suggestions/ideas on how to integrate? Or should we create two separate entries, e.g. """"Negative capacity (poetry)"""" and """"Negative capacity (philosophy/social theory)""""?

Totally agree with you Direktor, and I am sure that your highly reasonable opinions and facts you are presenting on wikipedia are highly respected and accepted by the waste majority of its readers. Please, if you can, - do your regular check-ups of the articles concerning South Slavic languages and make sure they’re not presenting some misleading information. I would just add to this that although ‘the political reason is the officially maintained distaste of the so-called """"pan-Yugoslav commonness”’, this distaste should be ‘expressed’ in a more civilized manner than creating some non-acceptable partial maps showing only a half of the Shtokavian speaking area, or trying to camouflage the factual state of the close ties within the Central South Slavic system (language) at the templates featured in the articles about South Slavic languages and dialects. And most importantly - that ridiculous ‘pan-Yugo’ distaste which openly sends a message of hatred and separatism, should not, by any mean be reflected in the language area, because it only shows how low and how uncivilized its ‘supporters’ can be, no matter what their ‘not-supported-by anyone-in-scientific-world’ theories they may point out as their sources. 
And, at the end, as an example of a civilized political distaste between nations, here’s the example of Americans and Canadians. Majority of Canadians feel in a different extent, a kind of aversion towards Americans, especially since the start of the ‘George-Bush-era’ in USA. But still, nobody says that Canadians speak a ‘different language’ than Americans, and nobody tries to hide the common history facts and the strong cultural and economical ties that exist between these 2 countries. This is a typical way of overcoming any kind of ‘distaste’ in a human and civilized way, all the other ways are just a shame for humanity.

Let me be clear:

There are two groups who don't like the wall.

The two groups are: Palestinians who are against the two state solution
Settlers who are against the two state solution

Each of these groups think, that by using force (and God) they will eventually drive the other people out.
The Palestinians who object the two setate solution and the settler all see a big problem in the wall: It creates a border, a demarcation line.

PMDrive1061, I dont know why you are acting like this. It is really upsetting.
I have been spending hours and days trying to promote the usage of wikipedia here in kosovo.
there is hardly any information on things written down, and we need stubs.
How can I tell people to use wikipedia if they have thier work just deleted?
What is wrong with a stub? 

I think that it is rude to just delete someones work while they are editing it.
You have my email, contact details. I dont even have a backup of the page in wikipedia.
Now you are blocking me from editing ? That is really bad.

This is the way that you scare away new editors, many people here say that they have similar problems. 
How are we going to promote the usage of wikipedia? By deleting things?

Future, there is no private space within Wikipedia. I appreciate your enthousiasm about this issue, but it is not the end of the world and you should not be carried away. Editors at Georgia have for years tried to get to an agreement but it has never happened, why would you expect it to happen here? Wikipedia is a great institution, but edit wars and a certain degree of bias are an unavoidable part of its principles. (T) """,0,0,0,0,0,0
